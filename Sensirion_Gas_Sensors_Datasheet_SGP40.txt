1 Sensor Performance
Table 1 lists specifications characterizing the gas sensing performance. The SGP40 chip provides a digital raw signal (SRAW_VOC) which is sensitive to most VOC gases typically present in indoor environments and which is proportional to the logarithm of the resistance of the sensing material. This signal is intended for further processing by Sensirion’s robust Gas Index Algorithm, which is available on GitHub (see SGP40 product page on Sensirion’s webpage), to provide a VOC bases output signal that can be directly used for indoor air quality applications. For the specifications given below, ethanol in clean air has been used as proxy gas for typical indoor air events.

2.5 Hardware Interface Specifications
The SGP40 comes in a 6-pin DFN package, see Table 6. Figure 5 shows a typical application circuit. The VDD pin must be decoupled with an RC element. The required decoupling for VDDH depends on the power supply network connected to the sensor, a capacitor of 1 ?F is recommended. VDD and VDDH must be connected to one single supply VDD. The external pull- up resistors (e.g., Rp = 10 k?) are required to pull the SDA and SCL signal lines high. For dimensioning resistor sizes please take bus capacity and communication frequency into account (see section 7.1 of NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual for more details). It should be noted that pull-up resistors may be included in I/O circuits of microcontrollers. The die pad or center pad is electrically connected to GND. Hence, electrical considerations do not impose constraints on the wiring of the die pad. However, for mechanical stability it is recommended to solder the die pad to the PCB.

2.6 Environmental Stability
The SGP40 has been qualified based on the JEDEC JESD47 qualification test method. The Moisture Sensitivity Level classification of the SGP40 is MSL1, according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020. At the same time, it is recommended to further process the sensors within 1 year after date of delivery. The SGP40 should not be exposed to bright illumination by either sunlight or artificial light sources during operation.

2.7 Material Contents
The device is fully RoHS, REACH, Halogen-free, and WEEE compliant, e.g., free of Pb, Cd, and Hg.

3 Sensor Output Signal Description
3.1 Raw Signal Measurement
Calling the sgp40_measure_raw_signal command launches/continues the VOC measurement mode. It starts one measurement of the raw signal (SRAW_VOC) which is returned after 30 ms. Raw signal value in ticks is provided as one 16-bit word followed by one CRC byte (Figure 6). The raw signal in ticks is proportional to the logarithm of the sensor resistance. This signal is used as input for Sensirion’s Gas Index Algorithm to provide a processed VOC Index (see section 3.2 VOC Index Measurement). In case the Gas Index Algorithm is not used, discard the first measured value. Typically, a measurement is performed every second by calling the sgp40_measure_raw_signal command again every second without turning the heater off. To exit the VOC measurement mode, the master calls the sgp4x_turn_heater_off command which switches off the hotplate and puts the sensor in idle mode.


Figure 6 Process flow for performing a raw signal measurement with the SGP40. For enabling on-chip humidity compensation, current relative humidity and temperature values have to be supplied as part of the measurement command.
The SGP40 features an automatic on-chip humidity compensation of the raw signal. The feature remains disabled as long as default values for both humidity and temperature are sent together with the sgp40_measure_raw_signal command. For enabling the compensation, the measurement command includes two words (+ respective CRC bytes) where the first word represents the relative humidity and the second one represents the temperature.

3.2 VOC Index Measurement


Figure 7 Schematic of the driver and Gas Index Algorithm implementation on a microcontroller.
For best performance in indoor-air-quality use cases, Sensirion recommends processing the (humidity-compensated) raw signal SRAW_VOC through Sensirion’s powerful Gas Index Algorithm. This algorithm (Figure 7) automatically adapts its output to any indoor environment and maps all VOC events to a VOC Index scale ranging from 1 to 500 VOC Index points (Figure 8). The value 100 refers to the average indoor gas composition over the past 24 h. While values between 100 and 500 indicate a deterioration, values between 1 and 100 inform about improvement of the air quality. The Gas Index Algorithm is available on GitHub (see SGP40 product page on Sensirion’s webpage). The SGP40 raw signal needs to be provided to the Gas Index Algorithm at a sampling rate of 1 s.



Figure 8 Explanation of the VOC Index scale.

3.3 Built-in Self-Test
With the sgp40_execute_self_test command, users can perform an on-chip self-test for, e.g., in-line or end-of-line production testing. If this command is called when the sensor is in idle mode, the sensor returns to idle mode after the test (Figure 9). In case this command is called during VOC measurement mode (i.e., after calling the sgp40_measure_raw_signal command), the hotplate remains switched on thereafter. After 320 ms, the master can read a fixed data pattern (1 word + CRC byte) to check if the test was successful or not.


Figure 9 Possible ways of integrating the built-in self-test function.

3.4 Reading out The Sensor Serial Number
Every SGP40 sensor carries a unique serial number for identification purposes which is hard coded during sensor production. This number can be read out by using the sgp4x_get_serial_number command at any time in idle mode (Figure 10). After 1 ms, the chip responds with 3 words (each word followed by one CRC byte) which together constitute the serial number.


Figure 10 Process flow for reading out the serial number of the SGP40 sensor.

3.5 Sensor Start-up Behavior
The sensor starts powering-up after reaching the power-up threshold voltage of 1.7 V and enters idle mode after max. 0.6 ms. In this state, the sensor is ready to receive commands from the master.

4 Digital Interface Description
4.1 General Considerations
For detailed information about the I2C protocol itself and its detailed implementation, please, consult the document NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual. All SGP40 commands consist of two bytes (16 bits). The commands must not be followed by a CRC. Additionally, data sent to and returned from the sensor is transferred in packets of two bytes (16 bits) followed by a 1-byte (8 bit) CRC.

4.2 I2C Address
The sensor’s I2C address is 89 (decimal; hex.: 0x59). The I2C header is formed by the I2C address followed by a read or write bit.

4.3 I2C Voltage Levels
Input and output voltage levels are specified in section 6.1 of NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual. The sensor’s interface
is compatible with 1.7–3.6 V I2C bus voltage levels depending on the supply voltage level.

4.4 I2C Protocol Speed
The sensor supports I2C “standard-mode” and “fast-mode”, with a maximum clock frequency of 100 or 400 kHz, respectively.

4.5 I2C Sequences
The typical communication sequence between the I2C master (e.g., a microcontroller in a host device) and the sensor is described as follows and visualized in Figure 11:
1. The sensor is powered up.
2. The I2C master periodically calls the measurement command and reads data in the following sequence:
a. I2C master sends a measurement command.
b. I2C master waits until the measurement is finished either by waiting for the maximum execution time or by waiting for the expected duration and then poll data until the read header is acknowledged by the sensor (expected durations are listed in Table 8).
c. I2C master reads out the measurement result.


Figure 11 Possible I2C command sequences for communicating with the SGP40. Dark areas indicate that the sensor controls the SDA (data) line. First, the I2C master sends the write header writing a 16-bit command, potentially followed by two words of data with CRC bytes. For reading the measured data (from the built-in self-test and from the sensor measurement), the I2C master sends the read header and receives
one word of data with CRC byte. In case of reading out the serial number of the sensor, the master receives three words with CRC bytes.
With the acknowledgement of the measurement command, the SGP40 starts measuring. When the measurement is in progress, no communication with the sensor is possible and the sensor aborts the communication with a NACK condition. After the sensor has completed the measurement, the master can read the measurement results by sending an I2C read header. The sensor will acknowledge the reception of the read header and responds with data. The response data length is listed in Table 8 and is structured in data words, where one word consists of two bytes of data (most significant bit first) followed by a one-byte CRC

checksum. Each byte must be acknowledged by the master with an ACK condition for the sensor to continue sending data. If the sensor does not receive an ACK from the master after any byte of data, it will not continue sending data.
After receiving the checksum for the last word of data, a NACK and STOP condition have to be sent (see Figure 11). The I2C master can abort the read transfer with a NACK followed by a STOP condition after any data byte if it is not interested in subsequent data, e.g., the CRC byte or following data bytes, in order to save time. Note that the data cannot be read more than once, and access to data beyond the specified amount will return a pattern of high bits.

4.6 Checksum Calculation
The 8-bit CRC checksum transmitted after each data word is generated by the CRC algorithm according to the properties as stated in Table 7. The CRC covers the contents of the two previously transmitted data bytes.

The sensor opening with a typical diameter of 0.8 mm is offset to the bottom right corner on the top side of the package. The sensor chip is assembled on a Ni/Pd/Au plated copper lead frame. Sensor chip and lead frame are over-molded by a black, epoxy-based mold compound. Please note that the side walls of the package are diced and therefore the lead frame sidewall surfaces are not plated.

5.1 Traceability
All SGP40 sensors are laser marked for easy identification and traceability (Figure 12). The marking on the sensor top side consists of a pin-1 indicator and three lines of text. The top line consists of the pin-1 indicator which is located in the top left corner and the product name. The two lines at the bottom consist of 2 alphanumeric digits each. That code can be decoded by Sensirion only and allows for tracking on batch level through production, calibration, and testing – and will be provided upon justified request.
If viewed from below pin 1 is indicated by triangular shaped cut in the otherwise rectangular die pad. The dimensions of the triangular cut are shown in Figure 13, right. The sensor opening on the top side is not recommended for optical alignment.

5.4 Soldering Instructions
Standard reflow soldering ovens and “no clean” type 3 solder paste (as specified in IPC J-STD-005A) should be used for soldering the SGP40. The sensors are designed to withstand a soldering profile according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020. Peak temperatures of TP = 245 °C during up to tp = 30 s for Pb-free assembly in IR/Convection reflow ovens (see Figure 15) are recommended. In addition, we also recommend a maximum ramp-down rate of <4 °C s?1. Vapor phase or manual soldering should not be used in order to avoid damaging of the sensor. In case the PCB hosting the SGP40 chip passes through multiple solder cycles, it is recommended to assemble the SGP40 during the last solder cycle. Board wash and ultrasonic cleaning should be avoided. For general information (such as conformal coating), please also refer to the Handling and Assembly Instructions for SGPxx Gas Sensors.

conditions are TP = 245°C and tP ? 30 s for Pb-free assembly, TL < 220°C and tL < 150 s. Ramp-up rate <3°C s?1 and ramp-down rate <4°C s?1.
