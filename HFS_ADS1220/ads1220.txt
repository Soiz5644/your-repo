Description 


The 
ADS1220 
is 
a 
precision, 
24-bit, 
analog-to-digital 
converter 
(ADC) 
that 
offers 
many 
integrated 
features 
to 
reduce 
system 
cost 
and 
component 
count 
in 
applications 
measuring 
small 
sensor 
signals. 
The 
device 
features 
two 
differential 
or 
four 
single-ended 
inputs 
through 
a 
flexible 
input 
multiplexer 
(MUX), 
a 
low-noise, 
programmable 
gain 
amplifier 
(PGA), 
two 
programmable 
excitation 
current 
sources, 
a 
voltage 
reference, 
an 
oscillator, 
a 
low-side 
switch, 
and 
a 
precision 
temperature 
sensor. 


The 
device 
can 
perform 
conversions 
at 
data 
rates 
up 
to 
2000 
samples-per-second 
(SPS) 
with 
single-cycle 
settling. 
At 
20 
SPS, 
the 
digital 
filter 
offers 
simultaneous 
50-Hz 
and 
60-Hz 
rejection 
for 
noisy 
industrial 
applications. 
The 
internal 
PGA 
offers 
gains 
up 
to 
128 
V/V. 
This 
PGA 
makes 
the 
ADS1220 
ideallysuited 
for 
applications 
measuring 
small 
sensor 
signals, 
such 
as 
resistance 
temperature 
detectors 
(RTDs), 
thermocouples, 
thermistors, 
and 
resistive 
bridge 
sensors. 
The 
device 
supports 
measurements 
of 
pseudo-or 
fully-differential 
signals 
when 
using 
the 
PGA. 
Alternatively, 
the 
device 
can 
be 
configured 
to 
bypass 
the 
internal 
PGA 
while 
still 
providing 
high 
input 
impedance 
and 
gains 
up 
to 
4 
V/V, 
allowing 
for 
single-ended 
measurements. 


Power 
consumption 
is 
as 
low 
as 
120 
µA 
when 
operating 
in 
duty-cycle 
mode 
with 
the 
PGA 
disabled. 
The 
ADS1220 
is 
offered 
in 
a 
leadless 
VQFN-16 
or 
a 
TSSOP-16 
package 
and 
is 
specified 
over 
a 
temperature 
range 
of 
–40°C 
to 
+125°C.

Parameter 
Measurement 
Information 


7.1 
Noise 
Performance 
Delta-sigma 
(.S) 
analog-to-digital 
converters 
(ADCs) 
are 
based 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
oversampling. 
The 
input 
signal 
of 
a 
.S 
ADC 
is 
sampled 
at 
a 
high 
frequency 
(modulator 
frequency) 
and 
subsequently 
filtered 
and 
decimated 
in 
the 
digital 
domain 
to 
yield 
a 
conversion 
result 
at 
the 
respective 
output 
data 
rate. 
The 
ratio 
between 
modulator 
frequency 
and 
output 
data 
rate 
is 
called 
oversampling 
ratio 
(OSR). 
By 
increasing 
the 
OSR, 
and 
thus 
reducing 
the 
output 
data 
rate, 
the 
noise 
performance 
of 
the 
ADC 
can 
be 
optimized. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
inputreferred 
noise 
drops 
when 
reducing 
the 
output 
data 
rate 
because 
more 
samples 
of 
the 
internal 
modulator 
are 
averaged 
to 
yield 
one 
conversion 
result. 
Increasing 
the 
gain 
also 
reduces 
the 
input-referred 
noise, 
which 
is 
particularly 
useful 
when 
measuring 
low-level 
signals. 


Table 
1 
to 
Table 
8 
summarize 
the 
device 
noise 
performance. 
Data 
are 
representative 
of 
typical 
noise 
performance 
at 
TA 
= 
25°C 
using 
the 
internal 
2.048-V 
reference. 
Data 
shown 
are 
the 
result 
of 
averaging 
readings 
from 
a 
single 
device 
over 
a 
time 
period 
of 
approximately 
0.75 
seconds 
and 
are 
measured 
with 
the 
inputs 
internally 
shorted 
together. 
Table 
1, 
Table 
3, 
Table 
5 
and 
Table 
7 
list 
the 
input-referred 
noise 
in 
units 
of 
µVRMS 
for 
the 
conditions 
shown. 
Note 
that 
µVPP 
values 
are 
shown 
in 
parenthesis. 
Table 
2, 
Table 
4, 
Table 
6 
and 
Table 
8 
list 
the 
corresponding 
data 
in 
effective 
number 
of 
bits 
(ENOB) 
calculated 
from 
µVRMS 
values 
using 
Equation 
1. 
Note 
that 
noise-free 
bits 
calculated 
from 
peak-to-peak 
noise 
values 
using 
Equation 
2 
are 
shown 
in 
parenthesis. 


The 
input-referred 
noise 
(Table 
1, 
Table 
3, 
Table 
5 
and 
Table 
7) 
only 
changes 
marginally 
when 
using 
an 
external 
low-noise 
reference, 
such 
as 
the 
REF5020. 
To 
calculate 
ENOB 
numbers 
and 
noise-free 
bits 
when 
using 
a 
reference 
voltage 
other 
than 
2.048 
V, 
use 
Equation 
1 
to 
Equation 
3: 


ENOB 
= 
ln 
(Full-Scale 
Range 
/ 
VRMS-Noise) 
/ 
ln(2)

Detailed 
Description 


8.1 
Overview 
The 
ADS1220 
is 
a 
small, 
low-power, 
24-bit, 
.S 
ADC 
that 
offers 
many 
integrated 
features 
to 
reduce 
system 
cost 
and 
component 
count 
in 
applications 
measuring 
small 
sensor 
signals. 


In 
addition 
to 
the 
.S 
ADC 
core 
and 
single-cycle 
settling 
digital 
filter, 
the 
device 
offers 
a 
low-noise, 
high 
input 
impedance, 
programmable 
gain 
amplifier 
(PGA), 
an 
internal 
voltage 
reference, 
and 
a 
clock 
oscillator. 
The 
device 
also 
integrates 
a 
highly 
linear 
and 
accurate 
temperature 
sensor 
as 
well 
as 
two 
matched 
programmable 
current 
sources 
(IDACs) 
for 
sensor 
excitation. 
All 
of 
these 
features 
are 
intended 
to 
reduce 
the 
required 
external 
circuitry 
in 
typical 
sensor 
applications 
and 
improve 
overall 
system 
performance. 
An 
additional 
low-side 
power 
switch 
eases 
the 
design 
of 
low-power 
bridge 
sensor 
applications. 
The 
device 
is 
fully 
configured 
through 
four 
registers 
and 
controlled 
by 
six 
commands 
through 
a 
mode 
1 
SPI-compatible 
interface. 
The 
Functional 
Block 
Diagram 
section 
shows 
the 
device 
functional 
block 
diagram. 


The 
ADS1220 
ADC 
measures 
a 
differential 
signal, 
VIN, 
which 
is 
the 
difference 
in 
voltage 
between 
nodes 
AINP 
and 
AINN. 
The 
converter 
core 
consists 
of 
a 
differential, 
switched-capacitor, 
.S 
modulator 
followed 
by 
a 
digital 
filter. 
The 
digital 
filter 
receives 
a 
high-speed 
bitstream 
from 
the 
modulator 
and 
outputs 
a 
code 
proportional 
to 
the 
input 
voltage. 
This 
architecture 
results 
in 
a 
very 
strong 
attenuation 
of 
any 
common-mode 
signal. 


The 
device 
has 
two 
available 
conversion 
modes: 
single-shot 
and 
continuous 
conversion 
mode. 
In 
single-shot 
mode, 
the 
ADC 
performs 
one 
conversion 
of 
the 
input 
signal 
upon 
request 
and 
stores 
the 
value 
in 
an 
internal 
data 
buffer. 
The 
device 
then 
enters 
a 
low-power 
state 
to 
save 
power. 
Single-shot 
mode 
is 
intended 
to 
provide 
significant 
power 
savings 
in 
systems 
that 
require 
only 
periodic 
conversions, 
or 
when 
there 
are 
long 
idle 
periods 
between 
conversions. 
In 
continuous 
conversion 
mode, 
the 
ADC 
automatically 
begins 
a 
conversion 
of 
the 
input 
signal 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
previous 
conversion 
is 
completed. 
New 
data 
are 
available 
at 
the 
programmed 
data 
rate. 
Data 
can 
be 
read 
at 
any 
time 
without 
concern 
of 
data 
corruption 
and 
always 
reflect 
the 
most 
recently 
completed 
conversion.

Feature 
Description 
8.3.1 
Multiplexer 
The 
device 
contains 
a 
very 
flexible 
input 
multiplexer, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
38. 
Either 
four 
single-ended 
signals, 
two 
differential 
signals, 
or 
a 
combination 
of 
two 
single-ended 
signals 
and 
one 
differential 
signal 
can 
be 
measured. 
The 
multiplexer 
is 
configured 
by 
four 
bits 
(MUX[3:0]) 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
When 
single-ended 
signals 
are 
measured, 
the 
negative 
ADC 
input 
(AINN) 
is 
internally 
connected 
to 
AVSS 
by 
a 
switch 
within 
the 
multiplexer. 
For 
system-monitoring 
purposes, 
the 
analog 
supply 
(AVDD 
– 
AVSS) 
/ 
4 
or 
the 
currently-selected 
external 
reference 
voltage 
(V(REFPx) 
– 
V(REFNx)) 
/ 
4 
can 
be 
selected 
as 
inputs 
to 
the 
ADC. 
The 
multiplexer 
also 
offers 
the 
possibility 
to 
route 
any 
of 
the 
two 
programmable 
current 
sources 
to 
any 
analog 
input 
(AINx) 
or 
to 
any 
dedicated 
reference 
pin 
(REFP0, 
REFN0).

Multiplexer 


Electrostatic 
discharge 
(ESD) 
diodes 
to 
AVDD 
and 
AVSS 
protect 
the 
inputs. 
To 
prevent 
the 
ESD 
diodes 
from 
turning 
on, 
the 
absolute 
voltage 
on 
any 
input 
must 
stay 
within 
the 
range 
provided 
by 
Equation 
4: 


AVSS 
– 
0.3 
V 
< 
V(AINx) 
< 
AVDD 
+ 
0.3 
V 
(4) 


If 
the 
voltages 
on 
the 
input 
pins 
have 
any 
potential 
to 
violate 
these 
conditions, 
external 
Schottky 
clamp 
diodes 
or 
series 
resistors 
may 
be 
required 
to 
limit 
the 
input 
current 
to 
safe 
values 
(see 
the 
Absolute 
Maximum 
Ratings 
table). 
Overdriving 
an 
unused 
input 
on 
the 
device 
may 
affect 
conversions 
taking 
place 
on 
other 
input 
pins. 
If 
any 
overdrive 
on 
unused 
inputs 
is 
possible, 
TI 
recommends 
clamping 
the 
signal 
with 
external 
Schottky 
diodes.

8.3.2.1 
PGA 
Common-Mode 
Voltage 
Requirements 
To 
stay 
within 
the 
linear 
operating 
range 
of 
the 
PGA, 
the 
input 
signals 
must 
meet 
certain 
requirements 
that 
are 
discussed 
in 
this 
section. 


The 
outputs 
of 
both 
amplifiers 
(A1 
and 
A2) 
in 
Figure 
39 
can 
not 
swing 
closer 
to 
the 
supplies 
(AVSS 
and 
AVDD) 
than 
200 
mV. 
If 
the 
outputs 
OUTP 
and 
OUTN 
are 
driven 
to 
within 
200 
mV 
of 
the 
supply 
rails, 
the 
amplifiers 
saturate 
and 
consequently 
become 
nonlinear. 
To 
prevent 
this 
nonlinear 
operating 
condition 
the 
output 
voltages 
must 
meet 
Equation 
7: 


AVSS 
+ 
0.2 
V 
= 
V(OUTN), 
V(OUTP) 
= 
AVDD 
– 
0.2 
V 
(7) 


Translating 
the 
requirements 
of 
Equation 
7 
into 
requirements 
referred 
to 
the 
PGA 
inputs 
(AINP 
and 
AINN) 
is 
beneficial 
because 
there 
is 
no 
direct 
access 
to 
the 
outputs 
of 
the 
PGA. 
The 
PGA 
employs 
a 
symmetrical 
design, 
therefore 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
at 
the 
output 
of 
the 
PGA 
can 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
the 
same 
as 
the 
commonmode 
voltage 
of 
the 
input 
signal, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
40.

The 
common-mode 
voltage 
is 
calculated 
using 
Equation 
8: 


VCM 
= 
½ 
(V(AINP) 
+ 
V(AINN)) 
= 
½ 
(V(OUTP) 
+ 
V(OUTN)) 
(8) 
The 
voltages 
at 
the 
PGA 
inputs 
(AINP 
and 
AINN) 
can 
be 
expressed 
as 
Equation 
9 
and 
Equation 
10: 


V(AINP) 
= 
VCM 
+ 
½ 
VIN 
(9) 


V(AINN) 
= 
VCM 
– 
½ 
VIN 
(10) 
The 
output 
voltages 
(V(OUTP) 
and 
V(OUTN)) 
can 
then 
be 
calculated 
as 
Equation 
11 
and 
Equation 
12: 


V(OUTP) 
= 
VCM 
+

Gain 
·

(11) 


V(OUTN) 
= 
VCM 
–

·

(12) 


The 
requirements 
for 
the 
output 
voltages 
of 
amplifiers 
A1 
and 
A2 
(Equation 
7) 
can 
now 
be 
translated 
into 
requirements 
for 
the 
input 
common-mode 
voltage 
range 
using 
Equation 
11 
and 
Equation 
12, 
which 
are 
given 
in 
Equation 
13 
and 
Equation 
14:

(MAX) 
= 
AVDD 
–

·

(14) 


In 
order 
to 
calculate 
the 
minimum 
and 
maximum 
common-mode 
voltage 
limits, 
the 
maximum 
differential 
input 
voltage 
(VIN 
(MAX)) 
that 
occurs 
in 
the 
application 
must 
be 
used. 
VIN 
(MAX) 
can 
be 
less 
than 
the 
maximum 
possible 
FS 
value. 


In 
addition 
to 
Equation 
13, 
the 
minimum 
VCM 
must 
also 
meet 
Equation 
15 
because 
of 
the 
specific 
design 
implementation 
of 
the 
PGA.

The 
following 
discussion 
explains 
how 
to 
apply 
Equation 
13 
through 
Equation 
15 
to 
a 
hypothetical 
application. 
The 
setup 
for 
this 
example 
is 
AVDD 
= 
3.3 
V, 
AVSS 
= 
0 
V, 
and 
gain 
= 
16, 
using 
an 
external 
reference, 
Vref 
= 
2.5 
V. 
The 
maximum 
possible 
differential 
input 
voltage 
VIN 
= 
(V(AINP) 
– 
V(AINN)) 
that 
can 
be 
applied 
is 
then 
limited 
to 
the 
full-scale 
range 
of 
FSR 
= 
±2.5 
V 
/ 
16 
= 
±0.156 
V. 
Consequently, 
Equation 
13 
through 
Equation 
15 
yield 
an 
allowed 
VCM 
range 
of 
1.45 
V 
= 
VCM 
= 
1.85 
V. 


If 
the 
sensor 
signal 
connected 
to 
the 
inputs 
in 
this 
hypothetical 
application 
does 
not 
make 
use 
of 
the 
entire 
fullscale 
range 
but 
is 
limited 
to 
VIN 
(MAX) 
= 
±0.1 
V, 
for 
example, 
then 
this 
reduced 
input 
signal 
amplitude 
relaxes 
the 
VCM 
restriction 
to 
1.0 
V 
= 
VCM 
= 
2.3 
V. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
fully-differential 
sensor 
signal, 
each 
input 
(AINP, 
AINN) 
can 
swing 
up 
to 
±50 
mV 
around 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
(V(AINP) 
+ 
V(AINN)) 
/ 
2, 
which 
must 
remain 
between 
the 
limits 
of 
1.0 
V 
and 
2.3 
V. 
The 
output 
of 
a 
symmetrical 
wheatstone 
bridge 
is 
an 
example 
of 
a 
fully-differential 
signal. 
Figure 
43 
shows 
a 
situation 
where 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
of 
the

at 
the

limit. 
V(OUTN) 
is 
exactly 
at 
0.2

in 
this

Any 
further 
decrease 
in 
common-mode

(VCM)

In 
contrast, 
the 
signal 
of 
an 
RTD 
is 
of 
a 
pseudo-differential 
nature 
(if 
implemented 
as 
shown 
in 
the 
RTD 
Measurement 
section), 
where 
the 
negative 
input 
is 
held 
at 
a 
constant 
voltage 
other 
than 
0 
V 
and 
only 
the 
voltage 
on 
the 
positive 
input 
changes. 
When 
a 
pseudo-differential 
signal 
must 
be 
measured, 
the 
negative 
input 
in 
this 
example 
must 
be 
biased 
at 
a 
voltage 
between 
0.95 
V 
and 
2.25 
V. 
The 
positive 
input 
can 
then 
swing 
up 
to 
VIN 
(MAX) 
= 
100 
mV 
above 
the 
negative 
input. 
Note 
that 
in 
this 
case 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
changes 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
voltage 
on 
the 
positive 
input 
changes. 
That 
is, 
while 
the 
input 
signal 
swings 
between 
0 
V 
= 
VIN 
= 
VIN 
(MAX), 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
swings 
between 
V(AINN) 
= 
VCM 
= 
V(AINN) 
+ 
½ 
VIN 
(MAX). 
Satisfying 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirements 
for 
the 
maximum 
input 
voltage 
VIN 
(MAX) 
ensures 
the 
requirements 
are 
met 
throughout 
the 
entire 
signal 
range.

Bypassing 
the 
PGA 
At 
gains 
of 
1, 
2, 
and 
4, 
the 
device 
can 
be 
configured 
to 
disable 
and 
bypass 
the 
low-noise 
PGA 
by 
setting 
the 
PGA_BYPASS 
bit 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
Disabling 
the 
PGA 
lowers 
the 
overall 
power 
consumption 
and 
also 
removes 
the 
restrictions 
of 
Equation 
13 
through 
Equation 
15 
for 
the 
common-mode 
input 
voltage 
range, 
VCM. 
The 
usable 
absolute 
and 
common-mode 
input 
voltage 
range 
is 
(AVSS 
– 
0.1 
V 
= 
V(AINx), 
VCM 
= 
AVDD 
+ 


0.1 
V) 
when 
the 
PGA 
is 
disabled. 
In 
order 
to 
measure 
single-ended 
signals 
that 
are 
referenced 
to 
AVSS 
(AINP 
= 
VIN, 
AINN 
= 
AVSS), 
the 
PGA 
must 
be 
bypassed. 
Configure 
the 
device 
for 
single-ended 
measurements 
by 
either 
connecting 
one 
of 
the 
analog 
inputs 
to 
AVSS 
externally 
or 
by 
using 
the 
internal 
AVSS 
connection 
of 
the 
multiplexer 
(MUX[3:0] 
settings 
1000 
through 
1011). 
When 
configuring 
the 
internal 
multiplexer 
for 
settings 
where 
AINN 
= 
AVSS 
(MUX[3:0] 
= 
1000 
through 
1011) 
the 
PGA 
is 
automatically 
bypassed 
and 
disabled 
irrespective 
of 
the 
PGA_BYPASS 
setting 
and 
gain 
is 
limited 
to 
1, 
2, 
and 
4. 
In 
case 
gain 
is 
set 
to 
greater 
than 
4, 
the 
device 
limits 
gain 
to 
4. 


When 
the 
PGA 
is 
disabled, 
the 
device 
uses 
a 
buffered 
switched-capacitor 
stage 
to 
obtain 
gains 
of 
1, 
2, 
and 
4. 
An 
internal 
buffer 
in 
front 
of 
the 
switched-capacitor 
stage 
ensures 
that 
the 
effect 
on 
the 
input 
loading 
resulting 
from 
the 
capacitor 
charging 
and 
discharging 
is 
minimal. 
See 
Figure 
21 
to 
Figure 
26 
for 
the 
typical 
values 
of 
absolute 
input 
currents 
(current 
flowing 
into 
or 
out 
of 
each 
input) 
and 
differential 
input 
currents 
(difference 
in 
absolute 
current 
between 
positive 
and 
negative 
input) 
when 
the 
PGA 
is 
disabled. 


For 
signal 
sources 
with 
high 
output 
impedance, 
external 
buffering 
may 
still 
be 
necessary. 
Note 
that 
active 
buffers 
introduce 
noise 
and 
also 
introduce 
offset 
and 
gain 
errors. 
Consider 
all 
of 
these 
factors 
in 
high-accuracy 
applications.

Digital 
Filter 
The 
device 
uses 
a 
linear-phase 
finite 
impulse 
response 
(FIR) 
digital 
filter 
that 
performs 
both 
filtering 
and 
decimation 
of 
the 
digital 
data 
stream 
coming 
from 
the 
modulator. 
The 
digital 
filter 
is 
automatically 
adjusted 
for 
the 
different 
data 
rates 
and 
always 
settles 
within 
a 
single 
cycle. 
At 
data 
rates 
of 
5 
SPS 
and 
20 
SPS, 
the 
filter 
can 
be 
configured 
to 
reject 
50-Hz 
or 
60-Hz 
line 
frequencies 
or 
to 
simultaneously 
reject 
50

and

Two 
bits 
(50/60[1:0]) 
in 
the

are 
used 
to 
configure 
the

oscillator 
or 
an 
external 
4.096-MHz 
clock. 


The 
filter 
notches 
and 
output 
data 
rate 
scale 
proportionally 
with 
the 
clock 
frequency. 
For 
example, 
a 
notch 
that 
appears 
at 
20 
Hz 
when 
using 
a 
4.096-MHz 
clock 
appears 
at 
10 
Hz 
if 
a 
2.048-MHz 
clock 
is 
used. 
Note 
that 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
can 
vary 
over 
temperature 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
Electrical 
Characteristics 
table. 
The 
data 
rate 
or 
conversion 
time, 
respectively, 
and 
filter 
notches 
consequently 
vary 
by 
the 
same 
amount. 
Consider 
using 
an 
external 
precision 
clock 
source 
if 
a 
digital 
filter 
notch 
at 
a 
specific 
frequency 
with 
a 
tighter 
tolerance 
is 
required.

8.3.5 
Output 
Data 
Rate 
Table 
11 
shows 
the 
actual 
conversion 
times 
for 
each 
data 
rate 
setting. 
The 
values 
provided 
are 
in 
terms 
of 
t(CLK)
cycles 
using 
an 
external 
clock 
with 
a 
clock 
frequency 
of 
f(CLK) 
= 
4.096 
MHz. 
The 
data 
rates 
scale 
proportionally 
in 
case 
an 
external 
clock 
with 
a 
frequency 
other 
than 
4.096 
MHz 
is 
used. 


Continuous 
conversion 
mode 
data 
rates 
are 
timed 
from 
one 
DRDY 
falling 
edge 
to 
the 
next 
DRDY 
falling 
edge. 
The 
first 
conversion 
starts 
210 
· 
t(CLK) 
(normal 
mode, 
duty-cycle 
mode) 
or 
114 
· 
t(CLK) 
(turbo 
mode) 
after 
the 
last 
SCLK 
falling 
edge 
of 
the 
START/SYNC 
command. 


Single-shot 
mode 
data 
rates 
are 
timed 
from 
the 
last 
SCLK 
falling 
edge 
of 
the 
START/SYNC 
command 
to 
the 
DRDY 
falling 
edge 
and 
rounded 
to 
the 
next 
t(CLK). 
In 
case 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
is 
used, 
an 
additional 
oscillator 
wake-up 
time 
of 
up 
to 
50 
µs 
(normal 
mode, 
duty-cycle 
mode) 
or 
25 
µs 
(turbo 
mode) 
must 
be 
added 
in 
single-shot 
mode. 
The 
internal 
oscillator 
starts 
to 
power 
up 
at 
the 
first 
SCLK 
rising 
edge 
of 
the 
START/SYNC 
command. 
If 
an 
SCLK 
frequency 
higher 
than 
160 
kHz 
(normal 
mode, 
duty-cycle 
mode) 
or 
320 
kHz 
(turbo 
mode) 
is 
used, 
the 
oscillator 
may 
not 
be 
fully 
powered 
up 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
START/SYNC 
command. 
The 
ADC 
then 
waits 
until 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
is 
fully 
powered 
up 
before 
starting 
a 
conversion. 


Single-shot 
conversion 
times 
in 
duty-cycle 
mode 
are 
the 
same 
as 
in 
normal 
mode. 
See 
the 
Duty-Cycle 
Mode 
section 
for 
more 
details 
on 
duty-cycle 
mode 
operation.

8.3.6 
Voltage 
Reference 
The 
device 
offers 
an 
integrated 
low-drift, 
2.048-V 
reference. 
For 
applications 
that 
require 
a 
different 
reference 
voltage 
value 
or 
a 
ratiometric 
measurement 
approach, 
the 
device 
offers 
two 
differential 
reference 
input 
pairs 
(REFP0, 
REFN0 
and 
REFP1, 
REFN1). 
In 
addition, 
the 
analog 
supply 
(AVDD) 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a 
reference. 


The 
reference 
source 
is 
selected 
by 
two 
bits 
(VREF[1:0]) 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
By 
default, 
the 
internal 
reference 
is 
selected. 
The 
internal 
voltage 
reference 
requires 
less 
than 
25 
µs 
to 
fully 
settle 
after 
power-up, 
when 
coming 
out 
of 
power-down 
mode, 
or 
when 
switching 
from 
an 
external 
reference 
source 
to 
the 
internal 
reference. 


The 
differential 
reference 
inputs 
allow 
freedom 
in 
the 
reference 
common-mode 
voltage. 
REFP0 
and 
REFN0 
are 
dedicated 
reference 
inputs 
whereas 
REFP1 
and 
REFN1 
are 
shared 
with 
inputs 
AIN0 
and 
AIN3, 
respectively. 
All 
reference 
inputs 
are 
internally 
buffered 
to 
increase 
input 
impedance. 
Therefore, 
additional 
reference 
buffers 
are 
usually 
not 
required 
when 
using 
an 
external 
reference. 
When 
used 
in 
ratiometric 
applications, 
the 
reference 
inputs 
do 
not 
load 
the 
external 
circuitry. 
Note 
that 
the 
analog 
supply 
current 
increases 
when 
using 
an 
external 
reference 
because 
the 
reference 
buffers 
are 
enabled. 


In 
most 
cases 
the 
conversion 
result 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
reference 
source. 
Any 
noise 
and 
drift 
of 
the 
voltage 
reference 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
conversion 
result. 


8.3.7 
Clock 
Source 
The 
device 
system 
clock 
can 
either 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
internal 
low-drift 
oscillator 
or 
by 
an 
external 
clock 
source 
on 
the 
CLK 
input. 
Connect 
the 
CLK 
pin 
to 
DGND 
before 
power-up 
or 
reset 
to 
activate 
the 
internal 
oscillator. 
Connecting 
an 
external 
clock 
to 
the 
CLK 
pin 
at 
any 
time 
deactivates 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
after 
two 
rising 
edges 
on 
the 
CLK 
pin 
are 
detected. 
The 
device 
then 
operates 
on 
the 
external 
clock. 
After 
the 
ADS1220 
switches 
to 
the 
external 
clock, 
the 
device 
can 
only 
be 
switched 
back 
to 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
by 
cycling 
the 
power 
supplies 
or 
by 
sending 
a 
RESET 
command. 


8.3.8 
Excitation 
Current 
Sources 
The 
device 
provides 
two 
matched 
programmable 
excitation 
current 
sources 
(IDACs) 
for 
RTD 
applications. 
The 
output 
current 
of 
the 
current 
sources 
can 
be 
programmed 
to 
10 
µA, 
50 
µA, 
100 
µA, 
250 
µA, 
500 
µA, 
1000 
µA, 
or 
1500 
µA 
using 
the 
respective 
bits 
(IDAC[2:0]) 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
Each 
current 
source 
can 
be 
connected 
to 
any 
of 
the 
analog 
inputs 
(AINx) 
as 
well 
as 
to 
any 
of 
the 
dedicated 
reference 
inputs 
(REFP0 
and 
REFN0). 
Both 
current 
sources 
can 
also 
be 
connected 
to 
the 
same 
pin. 
Routing 
of 
the 
IDACs 
is 
configured 
by 
bits 
(I1MUX[2:0], 
I2MUX[2:0]) 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken 
not 
to 
exceed 
the 
compliance 
voltage 
of 
the 
IDACs. 
In 
other 
words, 
limit 
the 
voltage 
on 
the 
pin 
where 
the 
IDAC 
is 
routed 
to 
= 
(AVDD 
– 
0.9 
V), 
otherwise 
the 
specified 
accuracy 
of 
the 
IDAC 
current 
is 
not 
met. 
For 
three-wire 
RTD 
applications, 
the 
matched 
current 
sources 
can 
be 
used 
to 
cancel 
errors 
caused 
by 
sensor 
lead 
resistance 
(see 
the 
3-Wire 
RTD 
Measurement 
section 
for 
more 
details). 


The 
IDACs 
require 
up 
to 
200 
µs 
to 
start 
up 
after 
the 
IDAC 
current 
is 
programmed 
to 
the 
respective 
value 
using 
bits 
IDAC[2:0]. 
If 
configuration 
registers 
2 
and 
3 
are 
not 
written 
during 
the 
same 
WREG 
command, 
TI 
recommends 
to 
first 
set 
the 
IDAC 
current 
to 
the 
respective 
value 
using 
bits 
IDAC[2:0] 
and 
thereafter 
select 
the 
routing 
for 
each 
IDAC 
(I1MUX[2:0], 
I2MUX[2:0]). 


In 
single-shot 
mode, 
the 
IDACs 
remain 
active 
between 
any 
two 
conversions 
if 
the 
IDAC[2:0] 
bits 
are 
set 
to 
a 
value 
other 
than 
000. 
However, 
the 
IDACs 
are 
powered 
down 
whenever 
the 
POWERDOWN 
command 
is 
issued. 


Note 
that 
the 
analog 
supply 
current 
increases 
when 
enabling 
the 
IDACs 
(that 
is, 
when 
the 
IDAC[2:0] 
bits 
are 
set 
to 
a 
value 
other 
than 
000). 
The 
IDAC 
circuit 
needs 
this 
bias 
current 
to 
operate 
even 
when 
the 
IDACs 
are 
not 
routed 
to 
any 
pin 
(I1MUX[2:0] 
= 
I2MUX[2:0] 
= 
000). 
In 
addition, 
the 
selected 
output 
current 
is 
drawn 
from 
the 
analog 
supply 
when 
I1MUX[2:0] 
or 
I2MUX[2:0] 
are 
set 
to 
a 
value 
other 
than 
000. 


8.3.9 
Low-Side 
Power 
Switch 
A 
low-side 
power 
switch 
with 
low 
on-resistance 
connected 
between 
the 
analog 
input 
AIN3/REFN1 
and 
AVSS 
is 
integrated 
in 
the 
device 
as 
well. 
This 
power 
switch 
can 
be 
used 
to 
reduce 
system 
power 
consumption 
in 
bridge 
sensor 
applications 
by 
powering 
down 
the 
bridge 
circuit 
between 
conversions. 
When 
the 
respective 
bit 
(PSW) 
in 
the 
configuration 
register 
is 
set, 
the 
switch 
automatically 
closes 
when 
the 
START/SYNC 
command 
is 
sent 
and 
opens 
when 
the 
POWERDOWN 
command 
is 
issued. 
Note 
that 
the 
switch 
stays 
closed 
between 
conversions 
in 
single-shot 
mode 
in 
case 
the 
PSW 
bit 
is 
set 
to 
1. 
The 
switch 
can 
be 
opened 
at 
any 
time 
by 
setting 
the 
PSW 
bit 
to 


0. 
By 
default, 
the 
switch 
is 
always 
open.

8.3.10 
Sensor 
Detection 
To 
help 
detect 
a 
possible 
sensor 
malfunction, 
the 
device 
provides 
internal 
10-µA, 
burn-out 
current 
sources. 
When 
enabled 
by 
setting 
the 
respective 
bit 
(BCS) 
in 
the 
configuration 
register, 
one 
current 
source 
sources 
current 
to 
the 
positive 
analog 
input 
(AINP) 
currently 
selected 
while 
the 
other 
current 
source 
sinks 
current 
form 
the 
selected 
negative 
analog 
input 
(AINN). 


In 
case 
of 
an 
open 
circuit 
in 
the 
sensor, 
these 
burn-out 
current 
sources 
pull 
the 
positive 
input 
towards 
AVDD 
and 
the 
negative 
input 
towards 
AVSS, 
resulting 
in 
a 
full-scale 
reading. 
A 
full-scale 
reading 
may 
also 
indicate 
that 
the 
sensor 
is 
overloaded 
or 
that 
the 
reference 
voltage 
is 
absent. 
A 
near-zero 
reading 
may 
indicate 
a 
shorted 
sensor. 
Note 
that 
the 
absolute 
value 
of 
the 
burn-out 
current 
sources 
typically 
varies 
by 
±10% 
and 
the 
internal 
multiplexer 
adds 
a 
small 
series 
resistance. 
Therefore, 
distinguishing 
a 
shorted 
sensor 
condition 
from 
a 
normal 
reading 
can 
be 
difficult, 
especially 
if 
an 
RC 
filter 
is 
used 
at 
the 
inputs. 
In 
other 
words, 
even 
if 
the 
sensor 
is 
shorted, 
the 
voltage 
drop 
across 
the 
external 
filter 
resistance 
and 
the 
residual 
resistance 
of 
the 
multiplexer 
causes 
the 
output 
to 
read 
a 
value 
higher 
than 
zero. 


Keep 
in 
mind 
that 
ADC 
readings 
of 
a 
functional 
sensor 
may 
be 
corrupted 
when 
the 
burn-out 
current 
sources 
are 
enabled. 
TI 
recommends 
disabling 
the 
burn-out 
current 
sources 
when 
preforming 
the 
precision 
measurement, 
and 
only 
enabling 
them 
to 
test 
for 
sensor 
fault 
conditions. 


8.3.11 
System 
Monitor 
The 
device 
provides 
some 
means 
for 
monitoring 
the 
analog 
power 
supply 
and 
the 
external 
voltage 
reference. 
To 
select 
a 
monitoring 
voltage, 
the 
internal 
multiplexer 
(MUX[3:0]) 
must 
be 
configured 
accordingly 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
The 
device 
automatically 
bypasses 
the 
PGA 
and 
sets 
the 
gain 
to 
1, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
configuration 
register 
settings 
while 
the 
monitoring 
feature 
is 
used. 
Note 
that 
the 
system 
monitor 
function 
only 
provides 
a 
coarse 
result 
and 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
be 
a 
precision 
measurement. 


When 
measuring 
the 
analog 
power 
supply 
(MUX[3:0] 
= 
1101), 
the 
resulting 
conversion 
is 
approximately 
(AVDD 
– 
AVSS) 
/ 
4. 
The 
device 
uses 
the 
internal 
2.048-V 
reference 
for 
the 
measurement 
regardless 
of 
what 
reference 
source 
is 
selected 
in 
the 
configuration 
register 
(VREF[1:0]). 


When 
monitoring 
one 
of 
the 
two 
possible 
external 
reference 
voltage 
sources 
(MUX[3:0] 
= 
1100), 
the 
result 
is 
approximately 
(V(REFPx) 
– 
V(REFNx)) 
/ 
4. 
REFPx 
and 
REFNx 
denote 
the 
external 
reference 
input 
pair 
selected 
in 
the 
configuration 
register 
(VREF[1:0]). 
The 
device 
automatically 
uses 
the 
internal 
reference 
for 
the 
measurement. 


8.3.12 
Offset 
Calibration 
The 
internal 
multiplexer 
offers 
the 
option 
to 
short 
both 
PGA 
inputs 
(AINP 
and 
AINN) 
to 
mid-supply 
(AVDD 
+ 
AVSS) 
/ 
2. 
This 
option 
can 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
and 
calibrate 
the 
device 
offset 
voltage 
by 
storing 
the 
result 
of 
the 
shorted 
input 
voltage 
reading 
in 
a 
microcontroller 
and 
consequently 
subtracting 
the 
result 
from 
each 
following 
reading. 
TI 
recommends 
taking 
multiple 
readings 
with 
the 
inputs 
shorted 
and 
averaging 
the 
result 
to 
reduce 
the 
effect 
of 
noise.

8.3.13 
Temperature 
Sensor 
The 
ADS1220 
offers 
an 
integrated 
precision 
temperature 
sensor. 
The 
temperature 
sensor 
mode 
is 
enabled 
by 
setting 
bit 
TS 
= 
1 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
When 
in 
temperature 
sensor 
mode, 
the 
settings 
of 
configuration 
register 
0 
have 
no 
effect 
and 
the 
device 
uses 
the 
internal 
reference 
for 
measurement, 
regardless 
of 
the 
selected 
voltage 
reference 
source. 
Temperature 
readings 
follow 
the 
same 
process 
as 
the 
analog 
inputs 
for 
starting 
and 
reading 
conversion 
results. 
Temperature 
data 
are 
represented 
as 
a 
14-bit 
result 
that 
is 
left-justified 
within 
the 
24bit 
conversion 
result. 
Data 
are 
output 
starting 
with 
the 
most 
significant 
byte 
(MSB). 
When 
reading 
the 
three 
data 
bytes, 
the 
first 
14 
bits 
are 
used 
to 
indicate 
the 
temperature 
measurement 
result. 
One 
14-bit 
LSB 
equals 
0.03125°C. 
Negative 
numbers 
are 
represented 
in 
binary 
twos 
complement 
format,

8.4 
Device 
Functional 
Modes 
8.4.1 
Power-Up 
and 
Reset 
When 
the 
device 
powers 
up, 
a 
reset 
is 
performed. 
The 
reset 
process 
takes 
approximately 
50 
µs. 
After 
this 
power-up 
reset 
time, 
all 
internal 
circuitry 
(including 
the 
voltage 
reference) 
are 
stable 
and 
communication 
with 
the 
device 
is 
possible. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
reset 
process, 
the 
device 
sets 
all 
bits 
in 
the 
configuration 
registers 
to 
the 
respective 
default 
settings. 
By 
default, 
the 
device 
is 
set 
to 
single-shot 
mode. 
After 
power-up, 
the 
device 
performs 
a 
single 
conversion 
using 
the 
default 
register 
settings 
and 
then 
enters 
a 
low-power 
state. 
When 
the 
conversion 
is 
complete, 
the 
DRDY 
pin 
transitions 
from 
high 
to 
low. 
The 
high-to-low 
transition 
of 
the 
DRDY 
pin 
can 
be 
used 
to 
signal 
that 
the 
ADS1220 
is 
operational 
and 
ready 
to 
use. 
The 
power-up 
behavior 
is 
intended 
to 
prevent 
systems 
with 
tight 
power-supply 
requirements 
from 
encountering 
a 
current 
surge 
during 
power-up. 


8.4.2 
Conversion 
Modes 
The 
device 
can 
be 
operated 
in 
one 
of 
two 
conversion 
modes 
that 
can 
be 
selected 
by 
the 
CM 
bit 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
These 
conversion 
modes 
are 
single-shot 
and 
continuous 
conversion 
mode. 


8.4.2.1 
Single-Shot 
Mode 
In 
single-shot 
mode, 
the 
device 
only 
performs 
a 
conversion 
when 
a 
START/SYNC 
command 
is 
issued. 
The 
device 
consequently 
performs 
one 
single 
conversion 
and 
returns 
to 
a 
low-power 
state 
afterwards. 
The 
internal 
oscillator 
and 
all 
analog 
circuitry 
(except 
for 
the 
excitation 
current 
sources) 
are 
turned 
off 
while 
the 
device 
waits 
in 
this 
low-power 
state 
until 
the 
next 
conversion 
is 
started. 
In 
addition, 
every 
write 
access 
to 
any 
configuration 
register 
also 
starts 
a 
new 
conversion. 
Writing 
to 
any 
configuration 
register 
while 
a 
conversion 
is 
ongoing 
functions 
as 
a 
new 
START/SYNC 
command 
that 
stops 
the 
current 
conversion 
and 
restarts 
a 
single 
new 
conversion. 
Each 
conversion 
is 
fully 
settled 
(assuming 
the 
analog 
input 
signal 
settles 
to 
its 
final 
value 
before 
the 
conversion 
starts) 
because 
the 
device 
digital 
filter 
settles 
within 
a 
single 
cycle. 


8.4.2.2 
Continuous 
Conversion 
Mode 
In 
continuous 
conversion 
mode, 
the 
device 
continuously 
performs 
conversions. 
When 
a 
conversion 
completes, 
the 
device 
places 
the 
result 
in 
the 
output 
buffer 
and 
immediately 
begins 
another 
conversion. 


In 
order 
to 
start 
continuous 
conversion 
mode, 
the 
CM 
bit 
must 
be 
set 
to 
1 
followed 
by 
a 
START/SYNC 
command. 
The 
first 
conversion 
starts 
210 
· 
t(CLK) 
(normal 
mode, 
duty-cycle 
mode) 
or 
114 
· 
t(CLK) 
(turbo 
mode) 
after 
the 
last 
SCLK 
falling 
edge 
of 
the 
START/SYNC 
command. 
Writing 
to 
any 
configuration 
register 
during 
an 
ongoing 
conversion 
restarts 
the 
current 
conversion. 
TI 
recommends 
always 
sending 
a 
START/SYNC 
command 
immediately 
after 
the 
CM 
bit 
is 
set 
to 
1.

Device 
Functional 
Modes 
(continued) 


8.4.3 
Operating 
Modes 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
different 
conversion 
modes, 
the 
device 
can 
also 
be 
operated 
in 
different 
operating 
modes 
that 
can 
be 
selected 
to 
trade-off 
power 
consumption, 
noise 
performance, 
and 
output 
data 
rate. 
These 
modes 
are: 
normal 
mode, 
duty-cycle 
mode, 
turbo 
mode, 
and 
power-down 
mode. 


8.4.3.1 
Normal 
Mode 
Normal 
mode 
is 
the 
default 
mode 
of 
operation 
after 
power-up. 
In 
this 
mode, 
the 
internal 
modulator 
of 
the 
.S 
ADC 
runs 
at 
a 
modulator 
clock 
frequency 
of 
f(MOD) 
= 
f(CLK) 
/ 
16, 
where 
the 
system 
clock 
(f(CLK)) 
is 
either 
provided 
by 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
or 
the 
external 
clock 
source. 
The 
modulator 
frequency 
is 
256 
kHz 
when 
using 
the 
internal 
oscillator. 
Normal 
mode 
offers 
output 
data 
rate 
options 
ranging 
from 
20 
SPS 
to 
1 
kSPS 
with 
the 
internal 
oscillator. 
The 
data 
rate 
is 
selected 
by 
the 
DR[2:0] 
bits 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
In 
case 
an 
external 
clock 
source 
with 
a 
clock 
frequency 
other 
than 
4.096 
MHz 
is 
used, 
the 
data 
rates 
scale 
accordingly. 
For 
example, 
using 
an 
external 
clock 
with 
f(CLK) 
= 
2.048 
MHz 
yields 
data 
rates 
ranging 
from 
10 
SPS 
to 
500 
SPS. 


8.4.3.2 
Duty-Cycle 
Mode 
The 
noise 
performance 
of 
a 
.S 
ADC 
generally 
improves 
when 
lowering 
the 
output 
data 
rate 
because 
more 
samples 
of 
the 
internal 
modulator 
can 
be 
averaged 
to 
yield 
one 
conversion 
result. 
In 
applications 
where 
power 
consumption 
is 
critical, 
the 
improved 
noise 
performance 
at 
low 
data 
rates 
may 
not 
be 
required. 
For 
these 
applications, 
the 
device 
supports 
an 
automatic 
duty-cycle 
mode 
that 
can 
yield 
significant 
power 
savings 
by 
periodically 
entering 
a 
low-power 
state 
between 
conversions. 
In 
principle, 
the 
device 
runs 
in 
normal 
mode 
with 
a 
duty 
cycle 
of 
25%. 
This 
functionality 
means 
the 
device 
performs 
one 
conversion 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
when 
running 
in 
normal 
mode 
but 
then 
automatically 
enters 
a 
low 
power-state 
for 
three 
consecutive 
conversion 
cycles. 
The 
noise 
performance 
in 
duty-cycle 
mode 
is 
therefore 
comparable 
to 
the 
noise 
performance 
in 
normal 
mode 
at 
four 
times 
the 
data 
rate. 
Data 
rates 
in 
duty-cycle 
mode 
range 
from 
5 
SPS 
to 
250 
SPS 
with 
the 
internal 
oscillator. 


8.4.3.3 
Turbo 
Mode 
Applications 
that 
require 
higher 
data 
rates 
up 
to 
2 
kSPS 
can 
operate 
the 
device 
in 
turbo 
mode. 
In 
this 
mode, 
the 
internal 
modulator 
runs 
at 
a 
higher 
frequency 
of 
f(MOD) 
= 
f(CLK) 
/ 
8. 
f(MOD) 
equals 
512 
kHz 
when 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
or 
an 
external 
4.096-MHz 
clock 
is 
used. 
Note 
that 
the 
device 
power 
consumption 
increases 
because 
the 
modulator 
runs 
at 
a 
higher 
frequency. 
Running 
the 
ADS1220 
in 
turbo 
mode 
at 
a 
comparable 
output 
data 
rate 
as 
in 
normal 
mode 
yields 
better 
noise 
performance. 
For 
example, 
the 
input-referred 
noise 
at 
90 
SPS 
in 
turbo 
mode 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
input-referred 
noise 
at 
90 
SPS 
in 
normal 
mode. 


8.4.3.4 
Power-Down 
Mode 
When 
the 
POWERDOWN 
command 
is 
issued, 
the 
device 
enters 
power-down 
mode 
after 
completing 
the 
current 
conversion. 
In 
this 
mode, 
all 
analog 
circuitry 
(including 
the 
voltage 
reference 
and 
both 
IDACs) 
are 
powered 
down, 
the 
low-side 
power 
switch 
is 
opened, 
and 
the 
device 
typically 
only 
uses 
400 
nA 
of 
current. 
While 
in 
powerdown 
mode, 
the 
device 
holds 
the 
configuration 
register 
settings 
and 
responds 
to 
commands, 
but 
does 
not 
perform 
any 
data 
conversions. 


Issuing 
a 
START/SYNC 
command 
wakes 
up 
the 
device 
and 
either 
starts 
a 
single 
conversion 
or 
starts 
continuous 
conversion 
mode, 
depending 
on 
the 
conversion 
mode 
selected 
by 
the 
CM 
bit. 
Note 
that 
writing 
to 
any 
configuration 
register 
wakes 
up 
the 
device 
as 
well, 
but 
only 
starts 
a 
single 
conversion 
regardless 
of 
the 
selected 
conversion 
mode 
(CM).

8.5 
Programming 
8.5.1 
Serial 
Interface 
The 
SPI-compatible 
serial 
interface 
of 
the 
device 
is 
used 
to 
read 
conversion 
data, 
read 
and 
write 
the 
device 
configuration 
registers, 
and 
control 
device 
operation. 
Only 
SPI 
mode 
1 
(CPOL 
= 
0, 
CPHA 
= 
1) 
is 
supported. 
The 
interface 
consists 
of 
five 
control 
lines 
(CS, 
SCLK, 
DIN, 
DOUT/DRDY, 
and 
DRDY) 
but 
can 
be 
used 
with 
only 
four 
or 
even 
three 
control 
signals 
as 
well. 
The 
dedicated 
data-ready 
signal 
(DRDY) 
can 
be 
configured 
to 
be 
shared 
with 
DOUT/DRDY. 
If 
the 
serial 
bus 
is 
not 
shared 
with 
any 
other 
device, 
CS 
can 
be 
tied 
low 
permanently 
so 
that 
only 
signals 
SCLK, 
DIN, 
and 
DOUT/DRDY 
are 
required 
to 
communicate 
with 
the 
device. 


8.5.1.1 
Chip 
Select 
(CS) 
Chip 
select 
(CS) 
is 
an 
active-low 
input 
that 
selects 
the 
device 
for 
SPI 
communication. 
This 
feature 
is 
useful 
when 
multiple 
devices 
share 
the 
same 
serial 
bus. 
CS 
must 
remain 
low 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
serial 
communication. 
When 
CS 
is 
taken 
high, 
the 
serial 
interface 
is 
reset, 
SCLK 
is 
ignored, 
and 
DOUT/DRDY 
enters 
a 
high-impedance 
state; 
as 
such, 
DOUT/DRDY 
cannot 
indicate 
when 
data 
are 
ready. 
In 
situations 
where 
multiple 
devices 
are 
present 
on 
the 
bus, 
the 
dedicated 
DRDY 
pin 
can 
provide 
an 
uninterrupted 
monitor 
of 
the 
conversion 
status. 
If 
the 
serial 
bus 
is 
not 
shared 
with 
another 
peripheral, 
CS 
can 
be 
tied 
low. 


8.5.1.2 
Serial 
Clock 
(SCLK) 
The 
serial 
clock 
(SCLK) 
features 
a 
Schmitt-triggered 
input 
and 
is 
used 
to 
clock 
data 
into 
and 
out 
of 
the 
device 
on 
the 
DIN 
and 
DOUT/DRDY 
pins, 
respectively. 
Even 
though 
the 
input 
has 
hysteresis, 
TI 
recommends 
keeping 
the 
SCLK 
signal 
as 
clean 
as 
possible 
to 
prevent 
glitches 
from 
accidentally 
shifting 
the 
data. 
When 
the 
serial 
interface 
is 
idle, 
hold 
SCLK 
low. 


8.5.1.3 
Data 
Ready 
(DRDY) 
DRDY 
indicates 
when 
a 
new 
conversion 
result 
is 
ready 
for 
retrieval. 
When 
DRDY 
falls 
low, 
new 
conversion 
data 
are 
ready. 
DRDY 
transitions 
back 
high 
on 
the 
next 
SCLK 
rising 
edge. 
When 
no 
data 
are 
read 
during 
continuous 
conversion 
mode, 
DRDY 
remains 
low 
but 
pulses 
high 
for 
a 
duration 
of 
2 
· 
t(MOD) 
prior 
to 
the 
next 
DRDY 
falling 
edge. 
The 
DRDY 
pin 
is 
always 
actively 
driven, 
even 
when 
CS 
is 
high. 


8.5.1.4 
Data 
Input 
(DIN) 
The 
data 
input 
pin 
(DIN) 
is 
used 
along 
with 
SCLK 
to 
send 
data 
(commands 
and 
register 
data) 
to 
the 
device. 
The 
device 
latches 
data 
on 
DIN 
on 
the 
SCLK 
falling 
edge. 
The 
device 
never 
drives 
the 
DIN 
pin. 


8.5.1.5 
Data 
Output 
and 
Data 
Ready 
(DOUT/DRDY) 
DOUT/DRDY 
serves 
a 
dual-purpose 
function. 
This 
pin 
is 
used 
with 
SCLK 
to 
read 
conversion 
and 
register 
data 
from 
the 
device. 
Data 
on 
DOUT/DRDY 
are 
shifted 
out 
on 
the 
SCLK 
rising 
edge. 
DOUT/DRDY 
goes 
to 
a 
highimpedance 
state 
when 
CS 
is 
high. 


In 
addition, 
the 
DOUT/DRDY 
pin 
can 
also 
be 
configured 
as 
a 
data-ready 
indicator 
by 
setting 
the 
DRDYM 
bit 
high 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
DOUT/DRDY 
then 
transitions 
low 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
the 
DRDY 
pin 
goes 
low 
to 
indicate 
new 
conversion 
data 
are 
available. 
Both 
signals 
can 
be 
used 
to 
detect 
if 
new 
data 
are 
ready. 
However, 
because 
DOUT/DRDY 
is 
disabled 
when 
CS 
is 
high, 
the 
recommended 
method 
of 
monitoring 
the 
end 
of 
a 
conversion 
when 
multiple 
devices 
are 
present 
on 
the 
SPI 
bus 
is 
to 
use 
the 
dedicated 
DRDY 
pin. 


8.5.1.6 
SPI 
Timeout 
The 
ADS1220 
offers 
an 
SPI 
timeout 
feature 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
recover 
communication 
when 
a 
serial 
interface 
transmission 
is 
interrupted. 
This 
feature 
is 
especially 
useful 
in 
applications 
where 
CS 
is 
permanently 
tied 
low 
and 
is 
not 
used 
to 
frame 
a 
communication 
sequence. 
Whenever 
a 
complete 
command 
is 
not 
sent 
within 
13955 
· 
t(MOD) 
(normal 
mode, 
duty-cycle 
mode) 
or 
27910 
· 
t(MOD) 
(turbo 
mode), 
the 
serial 
interface 
resets 
and 
the 
next 
SCLK 
pulse 
starts 
a 
new 
communication 
cycle. 
See 
the 
Modulator 
section 
for 
details 
on 
the 
modulator 
frequency 
(f(MOD) 
= 
1 
/ 
t(MOD)) 
in 
the 
different 
operating 
modes. 
For 
the 
RREG 
and 
WREG 
commands, 
a 
complete 
command 
includes 
the 
command 
byte 
itself 
plus 
the 
register 
bytes 
that 
are 
read 
or 
written.

Data 
Format 
The 
device 
provides 
24 
bits 
of 
data 
in 
binary 
twos 
complement 
format. 
The 
size 
of 
one 
code 
(LSB) 
is 
calculated 
using 
Equation 
16. 


1LSB 
=(2·Vref/Gain)/224=+FS/223 
(16) 


A 
positive 
full-scale 
input 
[VIN 
= 
(+FS 
– 
1 
LSB) 
= 
(Vref 
/ 
Gain 
– 
1

produces 
an

of 
7FFFFFh 
and 
a 
negative 
full-scale 
input 
(VIN 
= 
–FS 
= 
–Vref 
/ 
Gain) 
produces 
an

of 
800000h. 
The

8.5.3 
Commands 
The 
device 
offers 
six 
different 
commands 
to 
control 
device 
operation, 
as 
shown 
in 
Table 
14. 
Four 
commands 
are 
stand-alone 
instructions 
(RESET, 
START/SYNC, 
POWERDOWN, 
and 
RDATA). 
The 
commands 
to 
read 
(RREG) 
and 
write 
(WREG) 
configuration 
register 
data 
from 
and 
to 
the 
device 
require 
additional 
information 
as 
part 
of 
the 
instruction.

8.5.3.1 
RESET 
(0000 
011x) 


Resets 
the 
device 
to 
the 
default 
values. 
Wait 
at 
least 
(50 
µs 
+ 
32 
· 
t(CLK)) 
after 
the 
RESET 
command 
is 
sent 
before 
sending 
any 
other 
command. 


8.5.3.2 
START/SYNC 
(0000 
100x) 


In 
single-shot 
mode, 
the 
START/SYNC 
command 
is 
used 
to 
start 
a 
single 
conversion, 
or 
(when 
sent 
during 
an 
ongoing 
conversion) 
to 
reset 
the 
digital 
filter, 
and 
then 
restarts 
a 
single 
new 
conversion. 
When 
the 
device 
is 
set 
to 
continuous 
conversion 
mode, 
the 
START/SYNC 
command 
must 
be 
issued 
one 
time 
to 
start 
converting 
continuously. 
Sending 
the 
START/SYNC 
command 
while 
converting 
in 
continuous 
conversion 
mode 
resets 
the 
digital 
filter 
and 
restarts 
continuous 
conversions. 


8.5.3.3 
POWERDOWN 
(0000 
001x) 


The 
POWERDOWN 
command 
places 
the 
device 
into 
power-down 
mode. 
This 
command 
shuts 
down 
all 
internal 
analog 
components, 
opens 
the 
low-side 
switch, 
turns 
off 
both 
IDACs, 
but 
holds 
all 
register 
values. 
In 
case 
the 
POWERDOWN 
command 
is 
issued 
while 
a 
conversion 
is 
ongoing, 
the 
conversion 
completes 
before 
the 
ADS1220 
enters 
power-down 
mode. 
As 
soon 
as 
a 
START/SYNC 
command 
is 
issued, 
all 
analog 
components 
return 
to 
their 
previous 
states. 


8.5.3.4 
RDATA 
(0001 
xxxx) 
The 
RDATA 
command 
loads 
the 
output 
shift 
register 
with 
the 
most 
recent 
conversion 
result. 
This 
command 
can 
be 
used 
when 
DOUT/DRDY 
or 
DRDY 
are 
not 
monitored 
to 
indicate 
that 
a 
new 
conversion 
result 
is 
available. 
If 
a 
conversion 
finishes 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
RDATA 
command 
byte, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
DRDY 
pin 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
read 
operation 
signals 
whether 
the 
old 
or 
the 
new 
result 
is 
loaded. 
If 
the 
old 
result 
is 
loaded, 
DRDY 
stays 
low, 
indicating 
that 
the 
new 
result 
is 
not 
read 
out. 
The 
new 
conversion 
result 
loads 
when 
DRDY 
is 
high. 


8.5.3.5 
RREG 
(0010 
rrnn) 
The 
RREG 
command 
reads 
the 
number 
of 
bytes 
specified 
by 
nn 
(number 
of 
bytes 
to 
be 
read 
– 
1) 
from 
the 
device 
configuration 
register, 
starting 
at 
register 
address 
rr. 
The 
command 
is 
completed 
after 
nn 
+ 
1 
bytes 
are 
clocked 
out 
after 
the 
RREG 
command 
byte. 
For 
example, 
the 
command 
to 
read 
three 
bytes 
(nn 
= 
10) 
starting 
at 
configuration 
register 
1 
(rr 
= 
01) 
is 
0010 
0110. 


8.5.3.6 
WREG 
(0100 
rrnn) 
The 
WREG 
command 
writes 
the 
number 
of 
bytes 
specified 
by 
nn 
(number 
of 
bytes 
to 
be 
written 
– 
1) 
to 
the 
device 
configuration 
register, 
starting 
at 
register 
address 
rr. 
The 
command 
is 
completed 
after 
nn 
+ 
1 
bytes 
are 
clocked 
in 
after 
the 
WREG 
command 
byte. 
For 
example, 
the 
command 
to 
write 
two 
bytes 
(nn 
= 
01) 
starting 
at 
configuration 
register 
0 
(rr 
= 
00) 
is 
0100 
0001. 
The 
configuration 
registers 
are 
updated 
on 
the 
last 
SCLK 
falling 
edge.

8.5.5 
Sending 
Commands 
The 
device 
serial 
interface 
is 
capable 
of 
full-duplex 
operation 
while 
reading 
conversion 
data 
when 
not 
using 
the 
RDATA 
command. 
Full-duplex 
operation 
means 
commands 
are 
decoded 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
conversion 
data 
are 
read. 
Commands 
can 
be 
sent 
on 
any 
8-bit 
data 
boundary 
during 
a 
data 
read 
operation. 
When 
a 
RREG 
or 
RDATA 
command 
is 
recognized, 
the 
current 
data 
read 
operation 
is 
aborted 
and 
the 
conversion 
data 
are 
corrupted, 
unless 
the 
command 
is 
sent 
while 
the 
last 
byte 
of 
the 
conversion 
result 
is 
retrieved. 
The 
device 
starts 
to 
output 
the 
requested 
data 
on 
DOUT/DRDY 
at 
the 
first 
SCLK 
rising 
edge 
after 
the 
command 
byte. 
To 
read 
data 
without 
interruption, 
keep 
DIN 
low 
while 
clocking 
out 
data. 


A 
WREG 
command 
can 
be 
sent 
without 
corrupting 
an 
ongoing 
read 
operation. 
Figure 
66 
shows 
an 
example 
for 
sending 
a 
WREG 
command 
to 
write 
two 
configuration 
registers 
while 
reading 
conversion 
data 
in 
continuous 
conversion 
mode. 
After 
the 
command 
is 
clocked 
in 
(after 
the 
32nd 
SCLK 
falling 
edge), 
the 
device 
resets 
the 
digital 
filter 
and 
starts 
converting 
with 
the 
new 
register 
settings. 
The 
WREG 
command 
can 
be 
sent 
on 
any 
of 
the 
8-bit 
boundaries.

the 
serial

That 
is, 
all

bits 
of

must 
be 
read 
after 
the 
RDATA 
command 
is

and 
all

registers 
must 
be

after 
a 
RREG 
command 
is 
sent 
before 
a 
new 
command 
can 
be 
issued.

8.5.6 
Interfacing 
with 
Multiple 
Devices 
When 
connecting 
multiple 
ADS1220 
devices 
to 
a 
single 
SPI 
bus, 
SCLK, 
DIN, 
and 
DOUT/DRDY 
can 
be 
safely 
shared 
by 
using 
a 
dedicated 
chip-select 
(CS) 
line 
for 
each 
SPI-enabled 
device. 
When 
CS 
transitions 
high 
for 
the 
respective 
device, 
DOUT/DRDY 
enters 
a 
3-state 
mode. 
Therefore, 
DOUT/DRDY 
cannot 
be 
used 
to 
indicate 
when 
new 
data 
are 
available 
if 
CS 
is 
high, 
regardless 
of 
the 
DRDYM 
bit 
setting 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
Only 
the 
dedicated 
DRDY 
pin 
indicates 
that 
new 
data 
are 
available, 
because 
the 
DRDY 
pin 
is 
actively 
driven 
even 
when 
CS 
is 
high. 


In 
some 
cases 
the 
DRDY 
pin 
cannot 
be 
interfaced 
to 
the 
microcontroller. 
This 
scenario 
can 
occur 
if 
there 
are 
insufficient 
GPIO 
channels 
available 
on 
the 
microcontroller 
or 
if 
the 
serial 
interface 
must 
be 
galvanically 
isolated 
and 
thus 
the 
amount 
of 
channels 
must 
be 
limited. 
Therefore, 
in 
order 
to 
evaluate 
when 
a 
new 
conversion 
of 
one 
of 
the 
devices 
is 
ready, 
the 
microcontroller 
can 
periodically 
drop 
CS 
to 
the 
respective 
device 
and 
poll 
the 
state 
of 
the 
DOUT/DRDY 
pin. 
When 
CS 
goes 
low, 
the 
DOUT/DRDY 
pin 
immediately 
drives 
either 
high 
or 
low, 
provided 
that 
the 
DRDYM 
bit 
is 
configured 
to 
1. 
If 
the 
DOUT/DRDY 
line 
drives 
low, 
when 
CS 
is 
taken 
low, 
new 
data 
are 
currently 
available. 
If 
the 
DOUT/DRDY 
line 
drives 
high, 
no 
new 
data 
are 
available. 
This 
procedure 
requires 
that 
DOUT/DRDY 
is 
high 
after 
reading 
each 
conversion 
result 
and 
before 
taking 
CS 
high. 
To 
make 
sure 
DOUT/DRDY 
is 
taken 
high, 
send 
8 
additional 
SCLKs 
with 
DIN 
held 
low 
after 
each 
data 
read 
operation. 
DOUT/DRDY 
reads 
high 
during 
the 
eight 
SCLKs 
after 
the 
conversion 
result 
is 
read, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
67. 
Alternatively, 
valid 
data 
can 
be 
retrieved 
from 
the 
device 
at 
any 
time 
without 
concern 
of 
data 
corruption 
by 
using 
the 
RDATA 
command.

8.6.1 
Configuration 
Registers 
The 
device 
has 
four 
8-bit 
configuration 
registers 
that 
are 
accessible 
through 
the 
serial 
interface 
using 
the 
RREG 
and 
WREG 
commands. 
The 
configuration 
registers 
control 
how 
the 
device 
operates 
and 
can 
be 
changed 
at 
any 
time 
without 
causing 
data 
corruption. 
After 
power-up 
or 
reset, 
all 
registers 
are 
set 
to 
the 
default 
values 
(which 
are 
all 
0). 
All 
registers 
retain 
their 
values 
during 
power-down 
mode.

Application 
and 
Implementation 


NOTE 
Information 
in 
the 
following 
applications 
sections 
is 
not 
part 
of 
the 
TI 
component 
specification, 
and 
TI 
does 
not 
warrant 
its 
accuracy 
or 
completeness. 
TI’s 
customers 
are 
responsible 
for 
determining 
suitability 
of 
components 
for 
their 
purposes. 
Customers 
should 
validate 
and 
test 
their 
design 
implementation 
to 
confirm 
system 
functionality. 


9.1 
Application 
Information 
The 
ADS1220 
is 
a 
precision, 
24-bit, 
.S 
ADC 
that 
offers 
many 
integrated 
features 
to 
ease 
the 
measurement 
of 
the 
most 
common 
sensor 
types 
including 
various 
types 
of 
temperature 
and 
bridge 
sensors. 
Primary 
considerations 
when 
designing 
an 
application 
with 
the 
ADS1220 
include 
analog 
input 
filtering, 
establishing 
an 
appropriate 
external 
reference 
for 
ratiometric 
measurements, 
and 
setting 
the 
common-mode 
input 
voltage 
for 
the 
internal 
PGA. 
Connecting 
and 
configuring 
the 
serial 
interface 
appropriately 
is 
another 
concern. 
These 
considerations 
are 
discussed 
in 
the 
following 
sections. 


9.1.1 
Serial 
Interface 
Connections 
The 
principle 
serial 
interface 
connections 
for 
the 
ADS1220 
are 
shown 
in 
Figure

Serial 
Interface 
Connections 


Most 
microcontroller 
SPI 
peripherals 
can 
operate 
with 
the 
ADS1220. 
The 
interface 
operates 
in 
SPI 
mode 
1 
where 
CPOL 
= 
0 
and 
CPHA 
= 
1. 
In 
SPI 
mode 
1, 
SCLK 
idles 
low 
and 
data 
are 
launched 
or 
changed 
only 
on 
SCLK 
rising 
edges; 
data 
are 
latched 
or 
read 
by 
the 
master 
and 
slave 
on 
SCLK 
falling 
edges. 
Details 
of 
the 
SPI 
communication 
protocol 
employed 
by 
the 
device 
can 
be 
found 
in 
the 
SPI 
Timing 
Requirements 
section. 


TI 
recommends 
placing 
47-O 
resistors 
in 
series 
with 
all 
digital 
input 
and 
output 
pins 
(CS, 
SCLK, 
DIN, 
DOUT/DRDY, 
and 
DRDY). 
This 
resistance 
smooths 
sharp 
transitions, 
suppresses 
overshoot, 
and 
offers 
some 
overvoltage 
protection. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
meet 
all 
SPI 
timing 
requirements 
because 
the 
additional 
resistors 
interact 
with 
the 
bus 
capacitances 
present 
on 
the 
digital 
signal 
lines.

9.1.2 
Analog 
Input 
Filtering 
Analog 
input 
filtering 
serves 
two 
purposes: 
first, 
to 
limit 
the 
effect 
of 
aliasing 
during 
the 
sampling 
process 
and 
second, 
to 
reduce 
external 
noise 
from 
being 
a 
part 
of 
the 
measurement. 


As 
with 
any 
sampled 
system, 
aliasing 
can 
occur 
if 
proper 
antialias 
filtering 
is 
not 
in 
place. 
Aliasing 
occurs 
when 
frequency 
components 
are 
present 
in 
the 
input 
signal 
that 
are 
higher 
than 
half 
the 
sampling 
frequency 
of 
the 
ADC 
(also 
known 
as 
the 
Nyquist 
frequency). 
These 
frequency 
components 
are 
folded 
back 
and 
show 
up 
in 
the 
actual 
frequency 
band 
of 
interest 
below 
half 
the 
sampling 
frequency. 
Note 
that 
inside 
a 
.S 
ADC, 
the 
input 
signal 
is 
sampled 
at 
the 
modulator 
frequency 
f(MOD) 
and 
not 
at 
the 
output 
data 
rate. 
The 
filter

Application 
Information 
(continued) 


Many 
sensor 
signals 
are 
inherently 
bandlimited; 
for 
example, 
the 
output 
of 
a 
thermocouple 
has 
a 
limited 
rate 
of 
change. 
In 
this 
case 
the 
sensor 
signal 
does 
not 
alias 
back 
into 
the 
pass-band 
when 
using 
a 
.S 
ADC. 
However, 
any 
noise 
pick-up 
along 
the 
sensor 
wiring 
or 
the 
application 
circuitry 
can 
potentially 
alias 
into 
the 
pass-band. 
Power 
line-cycle 
frequency 
and 
harmonics 
are 
one 
common 
noise 
source. 
External 
noise 
can 
also 
be 
generated 
from 
electromagnetic 
interference 
(EMI) 
or 
radio 
frequency 
interference 
(RFI) 
sources, 
such 
as 
nearby 
motors 
and 
cellular 
phones. 
Another 
noise 
source 
typically 
exists 
on 
the 
printed 
circuit 
board 
(PCB) 
itself 
in 
the 
form 
of 
clocks 
and 
other 
digital 
signals. 
Analog 
input 
filtering 
helps 
remove 
unwanted 
signals 
from 
affecting 
the 
measurement 
result. 


A 
first-order 
resistor-capacitor 
(RC) 
filter 
is 
(in 
most 
cases) 
sufficient 
to 
either 
totally 
eliminate 
aliasing, 
or 
to 
reduce 
the 
effect 
of 
aliasing 
to 
a 
level 
within 
the 
noise 
floor 
of 
the 
sensor. 
Ideally, 
any 
signal 
beyond 
f(MOD) 
/ 
2 
is 
attenuated 
to 
a 
level 
below 
the 
noise 
floor 
of 
the 
ADC. 
The 
digital 
filter 
of 
the 
ADS1220 
attenuates 
signals 
to 
a 
certain 
degree, 
as 
illustrated 
in 
the 
filter 
response 
plots 
in 
the 
Digital 
Filter 
section. 
In 
addition, 
noise 
components 
are 
usually 
smaller 
in 
magnitude 
than 
the 
actual 
sensor 
signal. 
Therefore, 
using 
a 
first-order 
RC 
filter 
with 
a 
cutoff 
frequency 
set 
at 
the 
output 
data 
rate 
or 
10x 
higher 
is 
generally 
a 
good 
starting 
point 
for 
a 
system 
design. 


Internal 
to 
the 
device, 
prior 
to 
the 
PGA 
inputs, 
is 
an 
EMI 
filter; 
see 
Figure 
39. 
The 
cutoff 
frequency 
of 
this 
filter 
is 
approximately 
31.8 
MHz, 
which 
helps 
reject 
high-frequency 
interferences. 


9.1.3 
External 
Reference 
and 
Ratiometric 
Measurements 
The 
full-scale 
range 
of 
the 
ADS1220 
is 
defined 
by 
the 
reference 
voltage 
and 
the 
PGA 
gain 
(FSR 
= 
±Vref 
/ 
Gain). 
An 
external 
reference 
can 
be 
used 
instead 
of 
the 
integrated 
2.048-V 
reference 
to 
adapt 
the 
FSR 
to 
the 
specific 
system 
needs. 
An 
external 
reference 
must 
be 
used 
if 
VIN 
> 
2.048 
V. 
For 
example, 
an 
external 
5-V 
reference 
and 
an 
AVDD 
= 
5 
V 
are 
required 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
a 
single-ended 
signal 
that 
can 
swing 
between 
0 
V 
and 
5 
V. 


The 
reference 
inputs 
of 
the 
device 
also 
allow 
the 
implementation 
of 
ratiometric 
measurements. 
In 
a 
ratiometric 
measurement 
the 
same 
excitation 
source 
that 
is 
used 
to 
excite 
the 
sensor 
is 
also 
used 
to 
establish 
the 
reference 
for 
the 
ADC. 
As 
an 
example, 
a 
simple 
form 
of 
a 
ratiometric 
measurement 
uses 
the 
same 
current 
source 
to 
excite 
both 
the 
resistive 
sensor 
element 
(such 
as 
an 
RTD) 
and 
another 
resistive 
reference 
element 
that 
is 
in 
series 
with 
the 
element 
being 
measured. 
The 
voltage 
that 
develops 
across 
the 
reference 
element 
is 
used 
as 
the 
reference 
source 
for 
the 
ADC. 
Because 
current 
noise 
and 
drift 
are 
common 
to 
both 
the 
sensor 
measurement 
and 
the 
reference, 
these 
components 
cancel 
out 
in 
the 
ADC 
transfer 
function. 
The 
output 
code 
is 
only 
a 
ratio 
of 
the 
sensor 
element 
and 
the 
value 
of 
the 
reference 
resistor. 
The 
value 
of 
the 
excitation 
current 
source 
itself 
is 
not 
part 
of 
the 
ADC 
transfer 
function. 


9.1.4 
Establishing 
a 
Proper 
Common-Mode 
Input 
Voltage 
The 
ADS1220 
can 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
various 
types 
of 
input 
signal 
configurations: 
single-ended, 
pseudodifferential, 
and 
fully-differential 
signals 
(which 
can 
be 
either 
unipolar 
or 
bipolar). 
However, 
configuring 
the 
device 
properly 
for 
the 
respective 
signal 
type 
is 
important. 


Signals 
where 
the 
negative 
analog 
input 
is 
fixed 
and 
referenced 
to 
analog 
ground 
(V(AINN) 
= 
0 
V) 
are 
commonly 
called 
single-ended 
signals. 
The 
common-mode 
voltage 
of 
a 
single-ended 
signal 
consequently 
varies 
between 
0 
V 
and 
VIN 
/ 
2. 
If 
the 
PGA 
is 
disabled 
and 
bypassed, 
the 
common-mode 
input 
voltage 
of 
the 
ADS1220 
can 
be 
as 
low 
as 
100 
mV 
below 
AVSS 
and 
as 
large 
as 
100 
mV 
above 
AVDD. 
Therefore, 
the 
PGA_BYPASS 
bit 
must 
be 
set 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
single-ended 
signals 
when 
a 
unipolar 
analog 
supply 
is 
used 
(AVSS 
= 
0 
V). 
Gains 
of 
1, 
2, 
and 
4 
are 
still 
possible 
in 
this 
configuration. 
Measuring 
a 
0-mA 
to 
20-mA 
or 
4-mA 
to 
20-mA 
signal 
across 
a 
load 
resistor 
of 
100 
O 
referenced 
to 
GND 
is 
a 
typical 
example. 
The 
ADS1220 
can 
directly 
measure 
the 
signal 
across 
the 
load 
resistor 
using 
a 
unipolar 
supply, 
the 
internal 
2.048-V 
reference, 
and 
gain 
= 
1 
when 
the 
PGA 
is 
bypassed. 


If 
gains 
larger 
than 
4 
are 
needed 
to 
measure 
a 
single-ended 
signal, 
the 
PGA 
must 
be 
enabled. 
In 
this 
case, 
a 
bipolar 
supply 
is 
required 
for 
the 
ADS1220 
to 
meet 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirement 
of 
the 
PGA. 


Signals 
where 
the 
negative 
analog 
input 
(AINN) 
is 
fixed 
at 
a 
voltage 
other 
the 
0 
V 
are 
referred 
to 
as 
pseudodifferential 
signals. 
The 
common-mode 
voltage 
of 
a 
pseudo-differential 
signal 
varies 
between 
V(AINN) 
and 
V(AINN) 
+

Fully-differential 
signals 
in 
contrast 
are 
defined 
as 
signals 
having 
a 
constant 
common-mode 
voltage 
where 
the 
positive 
and 
negative 
analog 
inputs 
swing 
180° 
out-of-phase 
but 
have 
the 
same 
amplitude.

Application 
Information 
(continued) 


The 
ADS1220 
can 
measure 
pseudo-differential 
and 
fully-differential 
signals 
both 
with 
the 
PGA 
enabled 
or 
bypassed. 
However, 
the 
PGA 
must 
be 
enabled 
in 
order 
to 
use 
gains 
greater 
than 
4. 
The 
common-mode 
voltage 
of 
the 
input 
signal 
must 
meet 
the 
input-common 
mode 
voltage 
restrictions 
of 
the 
PGA 
(as 
explained 
in 
the 
PGA 
Common-Mode 
Voltage 
Requirements 
section) 
when 
the 
PGA 
is 
enabled. 
Setting 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
at 
or 
near 
(AVSS 
+ 
AVDD) 
/ 
2 
in 
most 
cases 
satisfies 
the 
PGA 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirements. 


Signals 
where 
both 
the 
positive 
and 
negative 
inputs 
are 
always 
= 
0 
V 
are 
called 
unipolar 
signals. 
These 
signals 
can 
in 
general 
be 
measured 
with 
the 
ADS1220 
using 
a 
unipolar 
analog 
supply 
(AVSS 
= 
0 
V). 
As 
mentioned 
previously, 
the 
PGA 
must 
be 
bypassed 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
single-ended, 
unipolar 
signals 
when 
using 
a 
unipolar 
supply. 


A 
signal 
is 
called 
bipolar 
when 
either 
the 
positive 
or 
negative 
input 
can 
swing 
below 
0 
V. 
A 
bipolar 
analog 
supply 
(such 
as 
AVDD 
= 
2.5 
V, 
AVSS 
= 
–2.5 
V) 
is 
required 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
bipolar 
signals 
with 
the 
ADS1220. 
A 
typical 
application 
task 
is 
measuring 
a 
single-ended, 
bipolar 
±10 
V 
signal 
where 
AINN 
is 
fixed 
at 
0 
V 
while 
AINP 
swings 
between 
–10 
V 
and 
10 
V. 
The 
ADS1220 
cannot 
directly 
measure 
this 
signal 
because 
the 
10 
V 
exceeds 
the 
analog 
power-supply 
limits. 
However, 
one 
possible 
solution 
is 
to 
use 
a 
bipolar 
analog 
supply 
(AVDD 
= 
2.5 
V, 
AVSS 
= 
–2.5 
V), 
gain 
= 
1, 
and 
a 
resistor 
divider 
in 
front 
of 
the 
ADS1220. 
The 
resistor 
divider 
must 
divide 
the 
voltage 
down 
to 
= 
±2.048 
V 
to 
be 
able 
to 
measure 
it 
using 
the 
internal 
2.048-V 
reference. 


9.1.5 
Unused 
Inputs 
and 
Outputs 
To 
minimize 
leakage 
currents 
on 
the 
analog 
inputs, 
leave 
unused 
analog 
and 
reference 
inputs 
floating, 
or 
connect 
the 
inputs 
to 
mid-supply 
or 
to 
AVDD. 
AIN3/REFN1 
is 
an 
exception. 
Leave 
the 
AIN3/REFN1 
pin 
floating 
when 
not 
used 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
accidently 
shorting 
the 
pin 
to 
AVSS 
through 
the 
internal 
low-side 
switch. 
Connecting 
unused 
analog 
or 
reference 
inputs 
to 
AVSS 
is 
possible 
as 
well, 
but 
can 
yield 
higher 
leakage 
currents 
than 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
options. 


Do 
not 
float 
unused 
digital 
inputs; 
excessive 
power-supply 
leakage 
current 
can 
result. 
Tie 
all 
unused 
digital 
inputs 
to 
the 
appropriate 
levels, 
DVDD 
or 
DGND, 
even 
when 
in 
power-down 
mode. 
If 
CS 
is 
not 
used, 
tie 
this 
pin 
to 
DGND. 
If 
the 
internal 
oscillator 
is 
used, 
tie 
the 
CLK 
pin 
to 
DGND. 
If 
the 
DRDY 
output 
is 
not 
used, 
leave 
the 
pin 
unconnected 
or 
tie 
the 
pin 
to 
DVDD 
using 
a 
weak 
pullup 
resistor.

Detailed 
Design 
Procedure 
The 
biasing 
resistors 
RB1 
and 
RB2 
are 
used 
to 
set 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
of 
the 
thermocouple 
to 
within 
the 
specified 
common-mode 
voltage 
range 
of 
the 
PGA 
(in 
this 
example, 
to 
mid-supply 
AVDD 
/ 
2). 
If 
the 
application 
requires 
the 
thermocouple 
to 
be 
biased 
to 
GND, 
either 
a 
bipolar 
supply 
(for 
example, 
AVDD 
= 
2.5 
V 
and 
AVSS 
= 
–2.5 
V) 
must 
be 
used 
for 
the 
device 
to 
meet 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirement 
of 
the 
PGA, 
or 
the 
PGA 
must 
be 
bypassed. 
When 
choosing 
the 
values 
of 
the 
biasing 
resistors, 
care 
must 
be 
taken 
so 
that 
the 
biasing 
current 
does 
not 
degrade 
measurement 
accuracy. 
The 
biasing 
current 
flows 
through 
the 
thermocouple 
and 
can 
cause 
self-heating 
and 
additional 
voltage 
drops 
across 
the 
thermocouple 
leads. 
Typical 
values 
for 
the 
biasing 
resistors 
range 
from 
1 
MO 
to 
50 
MO.

In 
addition 
to 
biasing 
the 
thermocouple, 
RB1 
and 
RB2 
are 
also 
useful 
for 
detecting 
an 
open 
thermocouple 
lead. 
When 
one 
of 
the 
thermocouple 
leads 
fails 
open, 
the 
biasing 
resistors 
pull 
the 
analog 
inputs 
(AIN0 
and 
AIN1) 
to 
AVDD 
and 
AVSS, 
respectively. 
The 
ADC 
consequently 
reads 
a 
full-scale 
value, 
which 
is 
outside 
the 
normal 
measurement 
range 
of 
the 
thermocouple 
voltage, 
to 
indicate 
this 
failure 
condition. 


Although 
the 
device 
digital 
filter 
attenuates 
high-frequency 
components 
of 
noise, 
TI 
recommends 
providing 
a 
firstorder, 
passive 
RC 
filter 
at 
the 
inputs 
to 
further 
improve 
performance. 
The 
differential 
RC 
filter 
formed 
by 
RF1, 
RF2, 
and 
the 
differential 
capacitor 
CDIF 
offers 
a 
cutoff 
frequency 
that 
is 
calculated 
using 
Equation 
17. 


fC 
= 
1 
/ 
[2p 
· 
(RF1 
+ 
RF2) 
· 
CDIF] 
(17) 


Two 
common-mode 
filter 
capacitors 
(CM1 
and 
CM2) 
are 
also 
added 
to 
offer 
attenuation 
of 
high-frequency, 
common-mode 
noise 
components. 
TI 
recommends 
that 
the 
differential 
capacitor 
CDIF 
be 
at 
least 
an 
order 
of 
magnitude 
(10x) 
larger 
than 
the 
common-mode 
capacitors 
(CM1 
and 
CM2) 
because 
mismatches 
in 
the 
commonmode 
capacitors 
can 
convert 
common-mode 
noise 
into 
differential 
noise. 


The 
filter 
resistors 
RF1 
and 
RF2 
also 
serve 
as 
current-limiting 
resistors. 
These 
resistors 
limit 
the 
current 
into 
the 
analog 
inputs 
(AIN0 
and 
AIN1) 
of 
the 
device 
to 
safe 
levels 
if 
an 
overvoltage 
on 
the 
inputs 
occur. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken 
when 
choosing 
the 
filter 
resistor 
values 
because 
the 
input 
currents 
flowing 
into 
and 
out 
of 
the 
device 
cause 
a 
voltage 
drop 
across 
the 
resistors. 
This 
voltage 
drop 
shows 
up 
as 
an 
additional 
offset 
error 
at 
the 
ADC 
inputs. 
TI 
recommends 
limiting 
the 
filter 
resistor 
values 
to 
below 
1 
kO. 


The 
filter 
component 
values 
used 
in 
this 
design 
are: 
RF1 
= 
RF2 
= 
1 
kO, 
CDIF 
= 
100 
nF, 
and 
CCM1 
= 
CCM2 
= 
10 
nF. 


The 
highest 
measurement 
resolution 
is 
achieved 
when 
matching 
the 
largest 
potential 
input 
signal 
to 
the 
FSR 
of 
the 
ADC 
by 
choosing 
the 
highest 
possible 
gain. 
From 
the 
design 
requirement, 
the 
maximum 
thermocouple 
voltage 
occurs 
at 
T(TC) 
= 
1250°C 
and 
is 
V(TC) 
= 
50.644 
mV 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
tables 
published 
by 
the 
National 
Institute 
of 
Standards 
and 
Technology 
(NIST) 
using 
a 
cold-junction 
temperature 
of 
T(CJ) 
= 
0°C. 
A 
thermocouple 
produces 
an 
output 
voltage 
that 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
temperature 
difference 
between 
the 
thermocouple 
tip 
and 
the 
cold 
junction. 
If 
the 
cold 
junction 
is 
at 
a 
temperature 
below 
0°C, 
the 
thermocouple 
produces 
a 
voltage 
larger 
than 
50.644 
mV. 
The 
isothermal 
block 
area 
is 
constrained 
by 
the 
operating 
temperature 
range 
of 
the 
device. 
Therefore, 
the 
isothermal 
block 
temperature 
is 
limited 
to 
–40°C. 
A 
K-type 
thermocouple 
at 
T(TC) 
= 
1250°C 
produces 
an 
output 
voltage 
of 
V(TC) 
= 
50.644 
mV 
– 
(–1.527 
mV) 
= 
52.171 
mV 
when 
referenced 
to 
a 
cold-junction 
temperature 
of 
T(CJ) 
= 
–40°C. 
The 
maximum 
gain 
that 
can 
be 
applied 
when 
using 
the 
internal 
2.048-V 
reference 
is 
then 
calculated 
as 
(2.048 
V 
/ 
52.171 
mV) 
= 
39.3. 
The 
next 
smaller 
PGA 
gain 
setting 
the 
device 
offers 
is 
32. 


The 
device 
integrates 
a 
high-precision 
temperature 
sensor 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
cold 
junction. 
To 
measure 
the 
internal 
temperature 
of 
the 
ADS1220, 
the 
device 
must 
be 
set 
to 
internal 
temperature 
sensor 
mode 
by 
setting 
the 
TS 
bit 
to 
1 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
For 
best 
performance, 
careful 
board 
layout 
is 
critical 
to 
achieve 
good 
thermal 
conductivity 
between 
the 
cold 
junction 
and 
the 
device 
package. 


However, 
the 
device 
does 
not 
perform 
automatic 
cold-junction 
compensation 
of 
the 
thermocouple. 
This 
compensation 
must 
be 
done 
in 
the 
microcontroller 
that 
interfaces 
to 
the 
device. 
The 
microcontroller 
requests 
one 
or 
multiple 
readings 
of 
the 
thermocouple 
voltage 
from 
the 
device 
and 
then 
sets 
the 
device 
to 
internal 
temperature 
sensor 
mode 
(TS 
= 
1) 
to 
acquire 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
cold 
junction. 
An 
algorithm 
similar 
to 
the 
following 
must 
be 
implemented 
on 
the 
microcontroller 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
cold-junction 
temperature: 


1. 
Measure 
the 
thermocouple 
voltage, 
V(TC), 
between 
AIN0 
and 
AIN1. 
2. 
Measure 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
cold 
junction, 
T(CJ), 
using 
the 
temperature 
sensor 
mode 
of 
the 
ADS1220. 
3. 
Convert 
the 
cold-junction 
temperature 
into 
an 
equivalent 
thermoelectric 
voltage, 
V(CJ), 
using 
the 
tables 
or 
equations 
provided 
by 
NIST. 
4. 
Add 
V(TC) 
and 
V(CJ) 
and 
translate 
the 
summation 
back 
into 
a 
thermocouple 
temperature 
using 
the 
NIST 
tables 
or 
equations 
again. 
In 
some 
applications, 
the 
integrated 
temperature 
sensor 
of 
the 
ADS1220 
cannot 
be 
used 
(for 
example, 
if 
the 
accuracy 
is 
not 
high 
enough 
or 
if 
the 
device 
cannot 
be 
placed 
close 
enough 
to 
the 
cold 
junction). 
The 
additional 
analog 
input 
channels 
of 
the 
device 
can 
be 
used 
in 
this 
case 
to 
measure 
the 
cold-junction 
temperature 
with 
a 
thermistor, 
RTD, 
or 
an 
analog 
temperature 
sensor. 


To 
get 
an 
approximation 
of 
the 
achievable 
temperature 
resolution, 
the 
rms-Noise 
of 
the 
ADS1220 
at 
Gain

and 
DR

is 
divided 
by 
the 
average

a

the

Therefore, 
errors 
resulting

SBAS501C–MAY 
2013–REVISED 
AUGUST 
2016 


In 
order 
to 
implement 
a 
ratiometric 
3-wire 
RTD 
measurement 
using 
the 
device, 
IDAC1 
is 
routed 
to 
one 
of 
the 
leads 
of 
the 
RTD 
and 
IDAC2 
is 
routed 
to 
the 
second 
RTD 
lead. 
Both 
currents 
have 
the 
same 
value, 
which 
is 
programmable 
by 
the 
IDAC[2:0] 
bits 
in 
the 
configuration 
register. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
device 
ensures 
that 
both 
IDAC 
values 
are 
closely 
matched, 
even 
across 
temperature. 
The 
sum 
of 
both 
currents 
flows 
through 
a 
precision, 
low-drift 
reference 
resistor, 
RREF. 
The 
voltage, 
Vref, 
generated 
across 
the 
reference 
resistor 
(as 
shown 
in 
Equation 
19) 
is 
used 
as 
the 
ADC 
reference 
voltage. 
Equation 
19 
reduces 
to 
Equation 
20 
because 
IIDAC1 
= 
IIDAC2. 


Vref 
= 
(IIDAC1 
+ 
IIDAC2) 
· 
RREF 
(19) 
Vref 
= 
2 
· 
IIDAC1 
· 
RREF 
(20) 


To 
simplify 
the 
following 
discussion, 
the 
individual 
lead 
resistance 
values 
of 
the 
RTD 
(RLEADx) 
are 
set 
to 
zero. 
Only 
IDAC1 
excites 
the 
RTD 
to 
produce 
a 
voltage 
(VRTD) 
proportional 
to 
the 
temperature-dependable 
RTD 
value 
and 
the 
IDAC1 
value, 
as 
shown 
in 
Equation 
21. 


VRTD 
= 
RRTD 
(at 
temperature) 
· 
IIDAC1 
(21) 


The 
device 
internally 
amplifies 
the 
voltage 
across 
the 
RTD 
using 
the 
PGA 
and 
compares 
the 
resulting 
voltage 
against 
the 
reference 
voltage 
to 
produce 
a 
digital 
output 
code 
proportional 
to 
Equation 
22 
through 
Equation 
24:

Code 
. 
(RRTD

· 
Gain) 
/ 
(2 
· 
RREF) 
(24) 


As 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
Equation 
24, 
the 
output 
code 
only 
depends 
on 
the 
value 
of 
the 
RTD, 
the 
PGA 
gain, 
and 
the 
reference 
resistor 
(RREF), 
but 
not 
on 
the 
IDAC1 
value. 
The 
absolute 
accuracy 
and 
temperature 
drift 
of 
the 
excitation 
current 
therefore 
does 
not 
matter. 
However, 
because 
the 
value 
of 
the 
reference 
resistor 
directly 
affects 
the 
measurement 
result, 
choosing 
a 
reference 
resistor 
with 
a 
very 
low 
temperature 
coefficient 
is 
important 
to 
limit 
errors 
introduced 
by 
the 
temperature 
drift 
of 
RREF. 


The 
second 
IDAC2 
is 
used 
to 
compensate 
for 
errors 
introduced 
by 
the 
voltage 
drop 
across 
the 
lead 
resistance 
of 
the 
RTD. 
All 
three 
leads 
of 
a 
3-wire 
RTD 
typically 
have 
the 
same 
length 
and, 
thus, 
the 
same 
lead 
resistance. 
Also, 
IDAC1 
and 
IDAC2 
have 
the 
same 
value. 
Taking 
the 
lead 
resistance 
into 
account, 
the 
differential 
voltage 
(VIN) 
across 
the 
ADC 
inputs, 
AIN0 
and 
AIN1, 
is 
calculated 
using 
Equation 
25: 


–

VIN 
= 
IIDAC1 
· 
(RRTD 
+ 
RLEAD1) 
IIDAC2 
· 
RLEAD2 
(25) 


When 
RLEAD1 
= 
RLEAD2 
and 
IIDAC1 
= 
IIDAC2, 
Equation 
25 
reduces 
to 
Equation 
26: 


VIN 
= 
IIDAC1 
· 
RRTD 
(26) 


In 
other 
words, 
the 
measurement 
error 
resulting 
from 
the 
voltage 
drop 
across 
the 
RTD 
lead 
resistance 
is 
compensated, 
as 
long 
as 
the 
lead 
resistance 
values 
and 
the 
IDAC 
values 
are 
well 
matched. 


A 
first-order 
differential 
and 
common-mode 
RC 
filter 
(RF1, 
RF2, 
CDIF1, 
CCM1, 
and 
CCM2) 
is 
placed 
on 
the 
ADC 
inputs, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
the 
reference 
inputs 
(RF3, 
RF4, 
CDIF2, 
CCM3, 
and 
CCM4). 
The 
same 
guidelines 
for 
designing 
the 
input 
filter 
apply 
as 
described 
in 
the 
Thermocouple 
Measurement 
section. 
For 
best 
performance, 
TI 
recommends 
matching 
the 
corner 
frequencies 
of 
the 
input 
and 
reference 
filter. 
More 
detailed 
information 
on 
matching 
the 
input 
and 
reference 
filter 
can 
be 
found 
in 
application 
report 
RTD 
Ratiometric 
Measurements 
and 
Filtering 
Using 
the 
ADS1148 
and 
ADS1248 
(SBAA201). 


The 
reference 
resistor 
RREF 
not 
only 
serves 
to 
generate 
the 
reference 
voltage 
for 
the 
device, 
but 
also 
sets 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
of 
the 
RTD 
to 
within 
the 
specified 
common-mode 
voltage 
range 
of 
the 
PGA. 


When 
designing 
the 
circuit, 
care 
must 
also 
be 
taken 
to 
meet 
the 
compliance 
voltage 
requirement 
of 
the 
IDACs. 
The 
IDACs 
require 
that 
the 
maximum 
voltage 
drop 
developed 
across 
the 
current 
path 
to 
AVSS 
be 
equal 
or 
less 
than 
AVDD 
– 
0.9 
V 
in 
order 
to 
operate 
accurately. 
This 
requirement 
means 
that 
Equation 
27 
must 
be 
met 
at 
all 
times. 


AVSS 
+ 
IIDAC1 
· 
(RLEAD1

+ 
IIDAC2) 
· 
(RLEAD3 
+ 
RREF) 
= 
AVDD 
– 
0.9 
V 
(27) 


The 
device 
also 
offers 
the 
possibility 
to 
route 
the 
IDACs 
to 
the 
same 
inputs 
used 
for 
measurement. 
If 
the 
filter 
resistor 
values 
RF1 
and 
RF2 
are 
small 
enough 
and 
well 
matched, 
IDAC1 
can 
be 
routed 
to 
AIN1 
and 
IDAC2 
to 
AIN0 
in 
Figure 
77. 
In 
this 
manner, 
even 
two 
3-wire 
RTDs 
sharing 
the 
same 
reference 
resistor 
can 
be 
measured 
with 
a 
single 
device.

This 
design 
example 
discusses 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
3-wire 
Pt100 
measurement 
to 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
temperatures 
ranging 
from 
–200°C 
to 
+850°C 
as 
stated 
in 
Table 
23. 
The 
excitation 
current 
for 
the 
Pt100 
is 
chosen 
as 
IIDAC1 
= 
500 
µA, 
which 
means 
a 
combined 
current 
of 
1 
mA 
is 
flowing 
through 
the 
reference 
resistor, 
RREF. 
As 
mentioned 
previously, 
besides 
creating 
the 
reference 
voltage 
for 
the 
ADS1220, 
the 
voltage 
across 
RREF 
also 
sets

RTD 
measurement. 
In 
general, 
choose 
the 
largest 
reference 
voltage 
possible 
while 
still 
maintaining 
the 
compliance 
voltage 
of 
the 
IDACs 
as 
well 
as 
meeting 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirement 
of 
the 
PGA. 
TI 
recommends 
setting 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
at 
or 
near 
half 
the 
analog 
supply 
(in 
this 
case 
3.3 
V 
/ 
2 
= 
1.65 
V), 
which 
in 
most 
cases 
satisfies 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirements 
of 
the 
PGA. 
The 
value 
for 
RREF 
is 
then 
calculated 
by 
Equation 
28: 


RREF 
= 
Vref 
/ 
(IIDAC1 
+ 
IIDAC2) 
= 
1.65 
V 
/ 
1 
mA 
= 
1.65 
kO 
(28) 


The 
stability 
of 
RREF 
is 
critical 
to 
achieve 
good 
measurement 
accuracy 
over 
temperature 
and 
time. 
Choosing 
a 
reference 
resistor 
with 
a 
temperature 
coefficient 
of 
±10 
ppm/°C 
or 
better 
is 
advisable. 
If 
a 
1.65 
kO 
value 
is 
not 
readily 
available, 
another 
value 
near 
1.65 
kO 
(such 
as 
1.62 
kO 
or 
1.69 
kO) 
can 
certainly 
be 
used 
as 
well. 


As 
a 
last 
step, 
the 
PGA 
gain 
must 
be 
selected 
in 
order 
to 
match 
the 
maximum 
input 
signal 
to 
the 
FSR 
of 
the 
ADC. 
The 
resistance 
of 
a 
Pt100 
increases 
with 
temperature. 
Therefore, 
the 
maximum 
voltage 
to 
be 
measured 
(VIN(MAX)) 
occurs 
at 
the 
positive 
temperature 
extreme. 
At 
850°C, 
a 
Pt100 
has 
an 
equivalent 
resistance 
of 
approximately 
391 
O 
as 
per 
the 
NIST 
tables. 
The 
voltage 
across 
the 
Pt100 
equates 
to 
Equation 
29: 


VIN 
(MAX) 
= 
VRTD 
(at 
850°C) 
= 
RRTD 
(at 
850°C) 
· 
IIDAC1 
= 
391 
O 
· 
500 
µA 
= 
195.5 
mV 
(29) 


The 
maximum 
gain 
that 
can 
be 
applied 
when 
using 
a 
1.65-V 
reference 
is 
then 
calculated 
as 
(1.65 
V 
/ 
195.5 
mV) 
= 
8.4. 
The 
next 
smaller 
PGA 
gain 
setting 
available 
in 
the 
ADS1220 
is 
8. 
At 
a 
gain 
of 
8, 
the 
ADS1220 
offers 
a 
FSR 
value 
as 
described 
in 
Equation 
30: 


FSR 
= 
±Vref 
/ 
Gain 
= 
±1.65 
V 
/ 
8 
= 
±206.25 
mV 
(30) 


This 
range 
allows 
for 
margin 
with 
respect 
to 
initial 
accuracy 
and 
drift 
of 
the 
IDACs 
and 
reference 
resistor. 


After 
selecting 
the 
values 
for 
the 
IDACs, 
RREF, 
and 
PGA 
gain, 
make 
sure 
to 
double 
check 
that 
the 
settings 
meet 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirements 
of 
the 
PGA 
and 
the 
compliance 
voltage 
of 
the 
IDACs. 
To 
determine 
the 
true 
common-mode 
voltage 
at 
the 
ADC 
inputs 
(AIN0 
and 
AIN1) 
the 
lead 
resistance 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
as 
well. 


The 
smallest 
common-mode 
voltage 
occurs 
at 
the 
lowest 
measurement 
temperature 
(–200°C) 
with 
RLEADx 
= 
0 
O 
and 
is 
calculated 
using 
Equation 
31 
and 
Equation 
32. 


VCM 
(MIN) 
= 
Vref 
+ 
(IIDAC1

IIDAC2)

V 
+ 
½ 
500 
µA 
· 
18.52 
O 
= 
1.655 
V 
(32) 


Actually, 
assuming 
VCM 
(MIN) 
= 
Vref 
is 
a 
sufficient 
approximation. 


VCM 
(MIN) 
must 
meet 
two 
requirements: 
Equation 
15 
requires 
VCM 
(MIN) 
to 
be 
larger 
than 
AVDD 
/ 
4 
= 
3.3 
V 
/ 
4 
= 


0.825 
V 
and 
Equation 
13 
requires 
VCM 
(MIN) 
to 
meet 
Equation 
33: 
VCM 
(MIN) 
= 
AVSS+0.2V+½Gain 
·VIN(MAX)=0V+0.2V+(½ 
·8·195.5mV) 
=982mV 
(33) 
Both 
restrictions 
are 
satisfied 
in 
this 
design 
with 
a 
VCM 
(MIN) 
= 
1.65 
V. 


The 
largest 
common-mode 
voltage 
occurs 
at 
the 
highest 
measurement 
temperature 
(850°C) 
and 
is 
calculated 
using 
Equation 
34 
and 
Equation 
35. 


VCM

Vref

V 
(35) 


VCM 
(MAX) 
does 
meet 
the 
requirement 
given 
by 
Equation 
14, 
which 
in 
this 
design 
equates 
to 
Equation 
36: 
VCM 
(MAX) 
= 
AVDD–0.2V 
–½Gain 
·VIN(MAX)=3.3V 
–0.2V 
–(½ 
·8·195.5mV) 
=2.318V 
(36) 


Finally, 
the 
maximum 
voltage 
that 
can 
occur 
on 
input 
AIN1 
must 
be 
calculated 
to 
determine 
if 
the 
compliance 
voltage 
(AVDD 
– 
0.9 
V 
= 
3.3 
V 
– 
0.9 
V 
= 
2.4 
V) 
of 
IDAC1 
is 
met. 
Note 
that 
the 
voltage 
on 
input 
AIN0 
is 
smaller 
than 
the 
one 
on 
input 
AIN1. 
Equation 
37 
and 
Equation 
38 
show 
that 
the 
voltage 
on 
AIN1 
is 
less 
than 
2.4 
V, 
even 
when 
taking 
the 
worst-case 
lead 
resistance 
into 
account.

Design 
Variations 
for 
2-Wire 
and 
4-Wire 
RTD 
Measurements 
Implementing 
a 
2-or 
4-wire 
RTD 
measurement 
is 
very 
similar 
to 
the 
3-wire 
RTD 
measurement 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
77, 
except 
that 
only 
one 
IDAC 
is 
required. 


Figure 
78 
shows 
a 
typical 
circuit 
implementation 
of 
a 
2-wire 
RTD 
measurement. 
The 
main 
difference 
compared 
to 
a 
3-wire 
RTD 
measurement 
is 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
lead 
resistance 
compensation. 
The 
voltage 
drop 
across 
the 
lead 
resistors, 
RLEAD1 
and 
RLEAD2, 
in 
this 
configuration 
is 
directly 
part 
of 
the 
measurement 
(as 
shown 
in 
Equation 
39) 
because 
there 
is 
no 
means 
to 
compensate 
the 
lead 
resistance 
by 
use 
of 
the 
second 
current 
source. 
Any 
compensation 
must 
be 
done 
by 
calibration.

Figure 
79 
shows 
a 
typical 
circuit 
implementation 
of 
a 
4-wire 
RTD 
measurement. 
Similar 
to 
the 
2-wire 
RTD 
measurement, 
only 
one 
IDAC 
is 
required 
for 
exciting 
and 
measuring 
a 
4-wire 
RTD 
in 
a 
ratiometric 
manner. 
The 
main 
benefit 
of 
using 
a 
4-wire 
RTD 
is 
that 
the 
ADC 
inputs 
are 
connected 
to 
the 
RTD 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
Kelvin 
connection. 
Apart 
from 
the 
input 
leakage 
currents 
of 
the 
ADC, 
there 
is 
no 
current 
flow 
through 
the 
lead 
resistors 
RLEAD2 
and 
RLEAD3 
and 
therefore 
no 
voltage 
drop 
is 
created 
across 
them. 
The 
voltage 
at 
the 
ADC 
inputs 
consequently 
equals 
the 
voltage 
across 
the 
RTD 
and 
the 
lead 
resistance 
is 
of 
no 
concern.

Note 
that 
because 
only 
one 
IDAC 
is 
used 
and 
flows 
through 
the 
reference 
resistor, 
RREF, 
the 
transfer 
function 
of 
a 
2-and 
4-wire 
RTD 
measurement 
differs 
compared 
to 
the 
one 
of 
a 
3-wire 
RTD 
measurement 
by 
a 
factor 
of 
2,

in 
Equation 
40.

In 
addition, 
the 
common-mode 
and 
reference 
voltage 
is 
reduced 
compared 
to 
the 
3-wire 
RTD 
configuration. 
Therefore, 
some 
further 
modifications 
may 
be 
required 
in 
case

the 
decreased

voltage 
does 
not 
meet 
the

of 
the 
PGA 
anymore, 
either 
increase 
the 
value 
of 
RREF 
by 
switching 
in 
a 
larger 
resistor 
or, 
alternatively, 
increase 
the 
excitation 
current 
while 
decreasing 
the 
gain 
at 
the 
same 
time.

9.2.3.2 
Detailed 
Design 
Procedure 
To 
implement 
a 
ratiometric 
bridge 
measurement, 
the 
bridge 
excitation 
voltage 
is 
simultaneously 
used 
as 
the 
reference 
voltage 
for 
the 
ADC, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
82. 
With 
this 
configuration, 
any 
drift 
in 
excitation 
voltage 
also 
shows 
up 
on 
the 
reference 
voltage, 
consequently 
canceling 
out 
drift 
error. 
Either 
of 
the 
two 
device 
reference 
input 
pairs 
can 
be 
connected 
to 
the 
bridge 
excitation 
voltage. 
However, 
only 
the 
negative 
reference 
input 
(REFN1) 
can 
be 
internally 
routed 
to 
a 
low-side 
power 
switch. 
By 
connecting 
the 
low 
side 
of 
the 
bridge 
to 
REFN1, 
the 
device 
can 
automatically 
power-down 
the 
bridge 
by 
opening 
the 
low-side 
power 
switch. 
When 
the 
PSW 
bit 
in 
the 
configuration 
register 
is 
set 
to 
1, 
the 
device 
opens 
the 
switch 
every 
time 
a 
POWERDOWN 
command 
is 
issued 
and 
closes 
the 
switch 
again 
when 
a 
START/SYNC 
command 
is 
sent. 


The 
PGA 
offers 
gains 
up 
to 
128, 
which 
helps 
amplify 
the 
small 
differential 
bridge 
output 
signal 
to 
make 
optimal 
use 
of 
the 
ADC 
full-scale 
range. 
Using 
a 
symmetrical 
bridge 
with 
the 
excitation 
voltage 
equal 
to 
the 
supply 
voltage 
of 
the 
device 
ensures 
that 
the 
output 
signal 
of 
the 
bridge 
meets 
the 
common-mode 
voltage 
requirement 
of 
the 
PGA.

Note 
that 
the 
maximum 
input 
voltage 
of 
ADS1220 
is 
limited 
to 
VIN 
(MAX) 
= 
±[(AVDD 
– 
AVSS) 
– 
0.4 
V] 
/ 
Gain, 
which 
means 
the 
entire 
full-scale 
range, 
FSR 
= 
±(AVDD 
– 
AVSS) 
/ 
Gain, 
cannot 
be 
used 
in 
this 
configuration. 
This 
limitation 
is 
a 
result 
of 
the 
output 
drive 
capability 
of 
the 
PGA 
amplifiers 
(A1 
and 
A2); 
see 
Figure 
39. 
The 
output 
of 
each 
amplifier 
must 
stay 
200 
mV 
away 
from 
the 
rails 
(AVDD 
and 
AVSS), 
otherwise 
the 
PGA 
becomes 
nonlinear. 
Consequently, 
the 
maximum 
output 
swing 
of 
the 
PGA 
is 
limited 
to 
VOUT 
= 
±[(AVDD 
– 
AVSS) 
– 
0.4 
V]. 


Using 
a 
3-mV/V 
load 
cell 
with 
a 
5-V 
excitation 
yields 
a 
maximum 
differential 
output 
voltage 
of 
VIN 
(MAX) 
= 
±15 
mV, 
which 
meets 
Equation 
41 
when 
using 
a 
gain 
of 
128. 


VIN

A 
first-order 
differential 
and 
common-mode 
RC 
filter 
(RF1, 
RF2, 
CDIF1, 
CCM1, 
and 
CCM2) 
is 
placed 
on 
the 
ADC 
inputs. 
The 
reference 
has 
an 
additional 
capacitor 
CDIF2 
to 
limit 
reference 
noise. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
maintain 
a 
limited 
amount 
of 
filtering 
or 
the 
measurement 
is 
no 
longer 
ratiometric. 


To 
find 
the 
repeatability 
of 
the 
readings, 
perform 
the 
following 
calculation. 
The 
load 
cell 
produces 
an 
output 
voltage 
of 
15 
mV 
at 
the 
maximum 
load 
of 
1 
kg. 
At 
a 
Gain 
= 
128 
and 
DR 
= 
20 
SPS 
the 
ADS1220 
offers 
a 
noisefree 
resolution 
of 
0.41 
µVpp. 
The 
repeatability 
is 
then 
calculated 
as 
shown 
in 
Equation 
42.

10 
Power 
Supply 
Recommendations 


The 
device 
requires 
two 
power 
supplies: 
analog 
(AVDD, 
AVSS) 
and 
digital 
(DVDD, 
DGND). 
The 
analog 
power 
supply 
can 
be 
bipolar 
(for 
example, 
AVDD 
= 
2.5 
V, 
AVSS 
= 
–2.5 
V) 
or 
unipolar 
(for 
example, 
AVDD 
= 
3.3 
V, 
AVSS 
= 
0 
V) 
and 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
digital 
power 
supply. 
The 
digital 
supply 
sets 
the 
digital 
I/O 
levels. 


10.1 
Power-Supply 
Sequencing 
The 
power 
supplies 
can 
be 
sequenced 
in 
any 
order, 
but 
in 
no 
case 
must 
any 
analog 
or 
digital 
inputs 
exceed 
the 
respective 
analog 
or 
digital 
power-supply 
voltage 
and 
current 
limits. 
Ramping 
DVDD 
together 
with 
or 
before 
AVDD 
minimizes 
any 
leakage 
current 
through 
AIN3/REFN1 
because 
of 
the 
low-side 
switch 
connected 
to 
this 
input. 
If 
AVDD 
ramps 
before 
DVDD, 
then 
the 
low-side 
switch 
is 
in 
an 
unknown 
state 
and 
can 
short 
the 
AIN3/REFN1 
input 
to 
AVSS 
until 
DVDD 
has 
ramped. 
Wait 
approximately 
50 
µs 
after 
all 
power 
supplies 
are 
stabilized 
before 
communicating 
with 
the 
device 
to 
allow 
the 
power-up 
reset 
process 
to 
complete. 


10.2 
Power-Supply 
Ramp 
Rate 
For 
proper 
device 
power-up 
over 
the 
entire 
temperature 
range, 
the 
power-supply 
ramp 
rate 
must 
be 
monotonic 
and 
slower 
than 
1 
V 
per 
50 
µs, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
83.

1 VDVDD

Power-Supply 
Ramp 
Rate 


10.3 
Power-Supply 
Decoupling 
Good 
power-supply 
decoupling 
is 
important 
to 
achieve 
optimum 
performance. 
AVDD, 
AVSS 
(when 
using 
a 
bipolar 
supply) 
and 
DVDD 
must 
be 
decoupled 
with 
at 
least 
a 
0.1-µF 
capacitor, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
84 
and 
Figure 
85. 
Place 
the 
bypass 
capacitors 
as 
close 
to 
the 
power-supply 
pins 
of 
the 
device 
as 
possible 
using 
lowimpedance 
connections. 
TI 
recommends 
using 
multi-layer 
ceramic 
chip 
capacitors 
(MLCCs) 
that 
offer 
low 
equivalent 
series 
resistance 
(ESR) 
and 
inductance 
(ESL) 
characteristics 
for 
power-supply 
decoupling 
purposes. 
For 
very 
sensitive 
systems, 
or 
for 
systems 
in 
harsh 
noise 
environments, 
avoiding 
the 
use 
of 
vias 
for 
connecting 
the 
capacitors 
to 
the 
device 
pins 
may 
offer 
superior 
noise 
immunity. 
The 
use 
of 
multiple 
vias 
in 
parallel 
lowers 
the 
overall 
inductance 
and 
is 
beneficial 
for 
connections 
to 
ground 
planes. 
TI 
recommends 
connecting 
analog 
and 
digital 
ground 
together 
as 
close 
to 
the 
device 
as 
possible.

11 
Layout 


11.1 
Layout 
Guidelines 
TI 
recommends 
employing 
best 
design 
practices 
when 
laying 
out 
a 
printed 
circuit 
board 
(PCB) 
for 
both 
analog 
and 
digital 
components. 
This 
recommendation 
generally 
means 
that 
the 
layout 
separates 
analog 
components 
[such 
as 
ADCs, 
amplifiers, 
references, 
digital-to-analog 
converters 
(DACs), 
and 
analog 
MUXs] 
from 
digital 
components 
[such 
as 
microcontrollers, 
complex 
programmable 
logic 
devices 
(CPLDs), 
field-programmable 
gate 
arrays 
(FPGAs), 
radio 
frequency 
(RF) 
transceivers, 
universal 
serial 
bus 
(USB) 
transceivers, 
and 
switching 
regulators]. 
An 
example 
of 
good 
component 
placement 
is 
shown 
in 
Figure 
86. 
Although 
Figure 
86 
provides 
a 
good 
example 
of 
component 
placement, 
the 
best 
placement 
for 
each 
application 
is 
unique 
to 
the 
geometries, 
components, 
and 
PCB 
fabrication 
capabilities 
employed. 
That 
is, 
there 
is 
no 
single 
layout 
that 
is 
perfect 
for 
every 
design 
and 
careful 
consideration 
must 
always 
be 
used 
when 
designing 
with 
any 
analog 
component.

System 
Component 
Placement 


The 
use 
of 
split 
analog 
and 
digital 
ground 
planes 
is 
not 
necessary 
for 
improved 
noise 
performance 
(although 
for 
thermal 
isolation 
this 
option 
is 
a 
worthwhile 
consideration). 
However, 
the 
use 
of 
a 
solid 
ground 
plane 
or 
ground 
fill 
in 
PCB 
areas 
with 
no 
components 
is 
essential 
for 
optimum 
performance. 
If 
the 
system 
being 
used 
employs 
a 
split 
digital 
and 
analog 
ground 
plane, 
TI 
generally 
recommends 
that 
the 
ground 
planes 
be 
connected 
together 
as 
close 
to 
the 
device 
as 
possible. 
A 
two-layer 
board 
is 
possible 
using 
common 
grounds 
for 
both 
analog 
and 
digital 
grounds. 
Additional 
layers 
can 
be 
added 
to 
simplify 
PCB 
trace 
routing. 
Ground 
fill 
may 
also 
reduce 
EMI 
and 
RFI 
issues. 


TI 
also 
strongly 
recommends 
that 
digital 
components, 
especially 
RF 
portions, 
be 
kept 
as 
far 
as 
practically 
possible 
from 
analog 
circuitry 
in 
a 
given 
system. 
Additionally, 
minimize 
the 
distance 
that 
digital 
control 
traces 
run 
through 
analog 
areas 
and 
avoid 
placing 
these 
traces 
near 
sensitive 
analog 
components. 
Digital 
return 
currents 
usually 
flow 
through 
a 
ground 
path 
that 
is 
as 
close 
to 
the 
digital 
path 
as 
possible. 
If 
a 
solid 
ground 
connection 
to 
a 
plane 
is 
not 
available, 
these 
currents 
may 
find 
paths 
back 
to 
the 
source 
that 
interfere 
with 
analog 
performance. 
The 
implications 
that 
layout 
has 
on 
the 
temperature-sensing 
functions 
are 
much 
more 
significant 
than 
for 
ADC 
functions. 


Supply 
pins 
must 
be 
bypassed 
to 
ground 
with 
a 
low-ESR 
ceramic 
capacitor. 
The 
optimum 
placement 
of 
the 
bypass 
capacitors 
is 
as 
close 
as 
possible 
to 
the 
supply 
pins. 
If 
AVSS 
is 
connected 
to 
a 
negative 
supply, 
then 
connect 
an 
additional 
bypass 
capacitor 
from 
AVSS 
to 
AGND 
as 
well. 
The 
ground-side 
connections 
of 
the 
bypass 
capacitors 
must 
be 
low-impedance 
connections 
for 
optimum 
performance. 
The 
supply 
current 
flows 
through 
the 
bypass 
capacitor 
terminal 
first 
and 
then 
to 
the 
supply 
pin 
to 
make 
the 
bypassing 
most 
effective. 


Analog 
inputs 
with 
differential 
connections 
must 
have 
a 
capacitor 
placed 
differentially 
across 
the 
inputs. 
Best 
input 
combinations 
for 
differential 
measurements 
are 
AIN0, 
AIN1 
and 
AIN2, 
AIN3. 
The 
differential 
capacitors 
must 
be 
of 
high 
quality. 
The 
best 
ceramic 
chip 
capacitors 
are 
C0G 
(NPO), 
which 
have 
stable 
properties 
and 
low 
noise 
characteristics. 
Thermally 
isolate 
a 
copper 
region 
around 
the 
thermocouple 
input 
connections 
to 
create 
a 
thermally-stable 
cold 
junction. 
Obtaining 
acceptable 
performance 
with 
alternate 
layout 
schemes 
is 
possible 
as 
long 
as 
the 
above 
guidelines 
are 
followed.

(1) Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle. 
(2) Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without 
limitation quality assurance, reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available 
for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind. 
(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition. 
(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the 
finish value exceeds the maximum column width. 
(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per 
JEDEC standards is shown. Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board. 
(6) Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part. 
Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the 
previous line and the two combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
