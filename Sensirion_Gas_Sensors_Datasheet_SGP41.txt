1 Sensor Performance
Table 1 lists specifications characterizing the gas sensing performance. The SGP41 chip provides two digital raw signals which are sensitive to most VOCs typically present in indoor environments and oxidizing gases such as NOx or O3, respectively. The raw signals are proportional to the logarithm of the resistance of the sensing material. For the specifications given below, ethanol in clean air has been used as proxy gas for typical VOC based indoor air events and NO2 in clean air has been used as proxy gas for typical oxidizing gas based indoor air events.

2.5 Interface Specifications
The SGP41 comes in a 6-pin DFN package, see Table 6. Figure 6 shows a typical application circuit. The VDD pin must be decoupled with an RC element. The required decoupling for VDDH depends on the power supply network connected to the sensor, a capacitor of 1 ?F is recommended. VDD and VDDH must be connected to one single supply VDD. The external pull- up resistors (e.g., Rp = 10 k?) are required to pull the SDA and SCL signal lines high. For dimensioning resistor sizes please take bus capacity and communication frequency into account (see section 7.1 of NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual for more details). It should be noted that pull-up resistors may be included in I/O circuits of microcontrollers. The die pad or center pad is electrically connected to GND. Hence, electrical considerations do not impose constraints on the wiring of the die pad. However, for mechanical stability it is recommended to solder the die pad to the PCB.

2.6 Environmental Stability
The SGP41 has been qualified based on the JEDEC JESD47 qualification test method. The Moisture Sensitivity Level classification of the SGP41 is MSL1, according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020. At the same time, it is recommended to further process the sensors within 1 year after date of delivery. The SGP41 should not be exposed to bright illumination by either sunlight or artificial light sources during operation.

2.7 Material Contents
The device is fully RoHS, REACH, Halogen-free, and WEEE compliant, e.g., free of Pb, Cd, and Hg.

3 Sensor Output Signal Description
3.1 Conditioning
After each restart of the sensor or when the hotplates have been switched off, the sgp41_execute_conditioning command must be called from idle mode before the master calls the first sgp41_measure_raw_signals command (Figure 7). The conditioning heats the hotplate of the NOx pixel to a different temperature compared to the measurement mode enabling a faster switch-on (as specified in Table 1) thereafter. It is recommended to execute the conditioning for 10 s, but 10 s must not be exceeded to avoid damage to the sensing material. Thereafter, the VOC+NOx measurement mode can be entered by following the instructions given in 3.2 Raw Signal Measurement. The conditioning command requires to send default input parameters (2 words + respective CRC bytes).



Figure 7 Standard process flow for executing the conditioning of SGP41.
Optionally, the master may already read out the raw signal of the VOC pixel (SRAW_VOC) during conditioning (Figure 8) since the hotplate of the VOC pixel will already be set to the temperature used in the VOC+NOx measurement mode. After calling the sgp41_execute_conditioning command and after a subsequent minimum waiting time of 50 ms, SRAW_VOC is returned as one 16-bit word followed by a CRC byte. The sgp41_execute_conditioning command can be called consecutively multiple times during the conditioning period.



Figure 8 Optional process flow for executing the conditioning of SGP41 and reading out the VOC raw signal.

3.2 Raw Signal Measurement
Calling the sgp41_measure_raw_signals command launches/continues the VOC+NOx measurement mode. The first call of this command should be performed after the conditioning (see 3.1 Conditioning). This command starts one measurement of the raw signals of the VOC and the NOx pixel (SRAW_VOC, SRAW_NOX) which are returned after 50 ms. The two raw signal values in ticks are provided as two 16-bit words each followed by one CRC byte (Figure 9). The raw signals in ticks are proportional each to the logarithm of the corresponding sensor resistance. These tow signals are used as input for Sensirion’s Gas Index Algorithm to provide processed VOC and NOx Indices (see section 3.3 VOC and NOx Index Measurement). In case the Gas Index Algorithm is not used, discard the first measured value of each signal. Typically, a measurement is performed every second by calling the sgp41_measure_raw_signals command again every second without turning the heater off. To exit the VOC+NOx measurement mode, the master calls the sgp4x_turn_heater_off command which switches off the hotplates and puts the sensor in idle mode. In order to avoid prolonged run-in of the NOx signal, it is recommended to keep the measurement running whenever possible.



Figure 9 Process flow for performing a raw signal measurement with the SGP41. For enabling on-chip humidity compensation, current relative humidity and temperature values have to be supplied as part of the measurement
command.
The SGP41 features an automatic on-chip humidity compensation of both raw signals. The feature remains disabled as long as default values for both humidity and temperature are sent together with the sgp41_measure_raw_signals command. For enabling the compensation, the measurement command includes two words (+ respective CRC bytes) where the first word represents the relative humidity and the second one represents the temperature.

3.3 VOC and NOx Index Measurement


Figure 10 Schematic of the driver and Gas Index Algorithm implementation on a microcontroller.
For best performance in indoor-air-quality use cases, Sensirion recommends processing the (humidity-compensated) raw signals SRAW_VOC and SRAW_NOX through Sensirion’s powerful Gas Index Algorithm. This algorithm (Figure 10) automatically adapts its outputs to any indoor environment and maps all VOC and NOx events to a VOC (Figure 11) and NOx Index (Figure 12) scale, respectively, ranging from 1 to 500 index points. In case of the VOC Index, a value of 100 refers to the average indoor gas composition over the past 24 h. While values between 100 and 500 indicate a deterioration, values between 1 and 100 inform about improvement of the VOC based air quality. In case of the NOx Index, the average condition is mapped to a value of 1 and therefore, the NOx Index displays values between 2 and 500 when NOx events are present. The Gas Index Algorithm is available on github (see SGP41 product page on Sensirion’s webpage). SGP41 raw signals need to be provided to the Gas Index Algorithm at a sampling rate of 1 s.

Figure 12 Explanation of the NOx Index scale.
3.4 Built-in Self-Test
With the sgp41_execute_self_test command, users can perform an on-chip self-test for, e.g., in-line or end-of-line production testing. If this command is called when the sensor is in idle mode, the sensor returns to idle mode after the test (Figure 13). In case this command is called during VOC+NOx measurement mode (i.e., after calling the sgp41_measure_raw_signals command), the hotplate remains switched on thereafter. It is not recommended to call this command during conditioning mode (i.e., after calling the sgp41_execute_conditioning command). After 320 ms, the master can read a fixed data pattern (1 word + CRC byte) to check if the test was successful or not.


Figure 13 Process flow for performing the built-in self-test.

3.5 Reading out The Sensor Serial Number
Every SGP41 sensor carries a unique serial number for identification purposes which is hard coded during sensor production. This number can be read out by using the sgp4x_get_serial_number command at any time in idle mode (Figure 14). After 1 ms, the chip responds with 3 words (each word followed by one CRC byte) which together constitute the serial number.


Figure 14 Process flow for reading out the serial number of the SGP41 sensor.

3.6 Sensor Start-up Behavior
The sensor starts powering-up after reaching the power-up threshold voltage of 1.7 V and enters idle mode after max. 0.6 ms. In this state, the sensor is ready to receive commands from the master.

4 Digital Interface Description
4.1 General Considerations
For detailed information about the I2C protocol itself and its detailed implementation, please, consult the document NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual. All SGP41 commands consist of two bytes (16 bits). The commands must not be followed by a CRC. Additionally, data sent to and returned from the sensor is transferred in packets of two bytes (16 bits) followed by a 1-byte (8 bit) CRC.

4.2 I2C Address
The sensor’s I2C address is 89 (decimal; hex.: 0x59). The I2C header is formed by the I2C address followed by a read or write bit.

4.3 I2C Voltage Levels
Input and output voltage levels are specified in section 6.1 of NXP I2C-bus specification and user manual. The sensor’s interface
is compatible with 1.7–3.6 V I2C bus voltage levels depending on the supply voltage level.

4.4 I2C Protocol Speed
The sensor supports I2C “standard-mode” and “fast-mode”, with a maximum clock frequency of 100 or 400 kHz, respectively.

4.5 I2C Sequences
The typical communication sequence between the I2C master (e.g., a microcontroller in a host device) and the sensor is described as follows and visualized in Figure 15:
1. The sensor is powered up.
2. The I2C master periodically calls the measurement command and reads data in the following sequence:
a. I2C master sends a measurement command.
b. I2C master waits until the measurement is finished either by waiting for the maximum execution time or by waiting for the expected duration and then poll data until the read header is acknowledged by the sensor (expected durations are listed in Table 8).
c. I2C master reads out the measurement result.


Figure 15 Possible I2C command sequences for communicating with the SGP41. Dark areas indicate that the sensor controls the SDA (data) line. First, the I2C master sends the write header writing a 16-bit command, potentially followed by two words of data with CRC bytes. For reading the measured data, the I2C master sends the read header and receives one word of data with CRC byte in case of the built-in self- test and in case of conditioning or two words with CRC bytes in case of measuring the raw signals of the two pixels. In case of reading out
the serial number of the sensor, the master receives three words with CRC bytes.
With the acknowledgement of the measurement command, the SGP41 starts measuring. When the measurement is in progress, no communication with the sensor is possible and the sensor aborts the communication with a NACK condition. After the sensor has completed the measurement, the master can read the measurement results by sending an I2C read header. The sensor will acknowledge the reception of the read header and responds with data. The response data length is listed in Table 8 and is

structured in data words, where one word consists of two bytes of data (most significant bit first) followed by a one-byte CRC checksum. Each byte must be acknowledged by the master with an ACK condition for the sensor to continue sending data. If the sensor does not receive an ACK from the master after any byte of data, it will not continue sending data.
After receiving the checksum for the last word of data, a NACK and STOP condition have to be sent (see Figure 15). The I2C master can abort the read transfer with a NACK followed by a STOP condition after any data byte if it is not interested in subsequent data, e.g., the CRC byte or following data bytes, in order to save time. Note that the data cannot be read more than once, and access to data beyond the specified amount will return a pattern of high bits.

4.6 Checksum Calculation
The 8-bit CRC checksum transmitted after each data word is generated by the CRC algorithm according to the properties as stated in Table 7. The CRC covers the contents of the two previously transmitted data bytes.

5 Mechanical Specifications
SGP41 sensors are provided in a DFN (dual flat no leads) package with an outline of 2.44 × 2.44× 0.85 mm3 and a terminal pitch of 0.8 mm. The sensor opening with a typical diameter of 0.8 mm is offset to the bottom right corner on the top side of the package. The sensor chip is assembled on a Ni/Pd/Au plated copper lead frame. Sensor chip and lead frame are over-molded by a black, epoxy-based mold compound. Please note that the side walls of the package are diced and therefore the lead frame sidewall surfaces are not plated.

5.1 Traceability
All SGP41 sensors are laser marked for easy identification and traceability (Figure 16). The marking on the sensor top side consists of a pin-1 indicator and three lines of text. The top line consists of the pin-1 indicator which is located in the top left corner and the product name. The two lines at the bottom consist of 2 alphanumeric digits each. That code can be decoded by Sensirion only and allows for tracking on batch level through production, calibration, and testing – and will be provided upon justified request.
If viewed from below pin 1 is indicated by triangular shaped cut in the otherwise rectangular die pad. The dimensions of the triangular cut are shown in Figure 17, right. The sensor opening on the top side is not recommended for optical alignment.

5.2 Package Outline



Figure 17 Package outline drawing of the SGP41. Dimensions are given in millimeters.
5.3 Land Pattern
Recommended land pattern of the SGP41 is shown in Figure 18. Pads on PCB are recommended to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Recommended solder paste stencil thickness is 125–150 ?m.


Figure 18 Recommended land pattern.
5.4 Soldering Instructions
Standard reflow soldering ovens and “no clean” type 3 solder paste (as specified in IPC J-STD-005A) should be used for soldering the SGP41. The sensors are designed to withstand a soldering profile according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020. Peak temperatures of TP = 245 °C during up to tp = 30 s for Pb-free assembly in IR/Convection reflow ovens (see Figure 19) are recommended. In addition, we also recommend a maximum ramp-down rate of <4 °C s?1. Vapor phase or manual soldering should not be used in order to avoid damaging of the sensor. In case the PCB hosting the SGP41 chip passes through multiple solder cycles, it is recommended to assemble the SGP41 during the last solder cycle. Board wash and ultrasonic cleaning should be avoided. For general information (such as conformal coating), please also refer to the Handling and Assembly Instructions for SGPxx Gas Sensors.



Figure 19 Soldering profile according to JEDEC standard. Recommended
conditions are TP = 245°C and tP ? 30 s for Pb-free assembly, TL < 220°C and tL < 150 s. Ramp-up rate <3°C s?1 and ramp-down rate <4°C s?1.
