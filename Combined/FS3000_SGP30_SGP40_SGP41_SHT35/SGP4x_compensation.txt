Table 9: Measure Raw Signal 
Command: sgp40_measure_raw_signal
Subcommand 1: Without humidity compensation
Command hex. Code: 0x26 0x0F 0x80 0x00 0xA2 0x66 0x66 0x93
Description: This command starts/continues the VOC measurement mode, leaves humidity compensation disabled by sending the default values (see Table 10), and returns the measured raw signal SRAW_VOC as 2 bytes (+ 1 CRC byte).
Subcommand 2: With humidity compensation
Command hex. Code: 0x26 0x0F 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xYY 0xYY 0xYY
Description: In order to enable the humidity compensation, the master has to specify the relative humidity 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX and temperature 0xYY 0xYY 0xYY input (incl. corresponding CRC bytes) in the format as given in Table 10.  Table 9 Description of the I2C measurement command.

Table 10: Conversion of relative humidity in % and temperature in °C into ticks as the input parameters of the measurement command. Note: minimum and maximum values do not reflect the range of conditions for which the humidity compensation feature has been optimized. For details see Table 4.
1. Relative Humidity 
Conversion into ticks: RH(ticks)=RH(%)×65'535/100
Default value: 50%, Hex. code: 0x80 0x00 + CRC 0xA2
Minimum value: 0%, Hex. code: 0x00 0x00 + CRC 0x81
Maximum value: 100%, Hex. code: 0xFF 0xFF + CRC 0xAC
2. Temperature
Conversion into ticks: T(ticks)= (T(°C)+45)×65'535/175
Default value: 25°C, Hex. code: 0x66 0x66 + CRC 0x93
Minimum value: -45°C, Hex. code: 0x00 0x00 + CRC 0x81
Maximum value: 130°C, Hex. code: 0xFF 0xFF + CRC 0xAC
